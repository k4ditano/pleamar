# The logic, in Luau

**Status:** implemented (`src/logic_luau.rs`). If there is a `marea.luau` next to `marea.plm`, that is its logic. It reloads itself when saved, just like the scene.

Examples: `examples/marea.luau` (notices coming in) and `examples/tray.luau` (a list of data that grows and shrinks).

## What it can do, and what it cannot

The logic **does not animate, does not paint and knows nothing about coordinates**. It lives on its own thread; the renderer never waits for it. Only this crosses the boundary:

```lua
fact.open = true                          -- say what is true. It reads back as what it is: `true`, a number, or `"critical"`
text["notice.title"] = "Meeting in 5 min" -- say what a live text says
emit("confirmed")                         -- that something has happened
play("joy")                               -- ask for a gesture (the scene will grant it or not, by its class)

on("view_event", function(n) … end)       -- an event the scene lets out (`event x ->`), with its payload
on("press:view", …)  on("release:view", …)  on("enter:orb", …)  on("leave:orb", …)
on("scroll:sound", function(notches) … end)   on("key", function(name, text) … end)
on("text:query", function(value) … end)   -- someone typed in the `query` field; `text.query` already holds it
on("submit:query", function(value) … end) -- Enter in the field
on("focus", …)  on("blur", …)             -- the surface gains or loses the keyboard
on("drop:tray", function(data, mime) … end)  -- something was dropped from another application: text, or a list of `file://…`
json.decode(text)  json.encode(t)  -- what a program prints (`run`'s output) as tables, and back
focus("query")                            -- give the typing caret to a field; `focus()` takes it away
on("layer:card", function(claim) … end)   -- a layer changed hands
on("fact:open", function(v) … end)        -- a scene RULE changed a fact
on("demo", …)                             -- the tick of `--demo`
on("frame", function(dt) … end)           -- every frame, before it is made: see «A logic that plays»
on("key_down", function(name) … end)  on("key_up", …)   -- a key going down (once) and coming up
held("Left")   mouse.x  mouse.left   pad(1)   hit.circles(…)   sound.tone({ … })   -- the same section

local t = every(1000, function() … end)   -- timers, in milliseconds
after(500, function() … end)
cancel(t)

run("date", { "+%H:%M" }, function(out, code) … end)   -- a system command; answers when it finishes
run("wl-copy", { "--type", "image/png" }, nil, { stdin = path, output = false })   -- how: a file on its input; and not waiting for what it writes
run("sudo", { "-S", "-p", "", "-v" }, function(_, code) … end, { input = pw .. "\n" })   -- a text on its input, which never touches a file, its arguments or its environment
local id = spawn("wf-recorder", { "-f", file }, function(line) … end, function(_, code) … end)   -- one that does not end: a call per line, and one when it HAS ended
spawn("pacman", args, on_line, on_exit, { input = "…", errors = true, env = { LC_ALL = "C" } })   -- how, too: a text on its input, its error output among the lines, and variables of its own (`env` and `errors` also for `run`: its error output after the rest)
local id = spawn("node", { "worker.mjs" }, on_line, on_exit, { stdin = "open" })   -- its input left open:
write(id, '{"type":"prompt"}\n')                       -- a line to it while it runs (true if it got there); write(id) closes it
kill(id, "int")                                       -- asks it to stop (or "term"); kill(id) alone kills it and forgets it
local id = spawn("pactl", { "subscribe" }, function(line) … end)   -- one that does NOT finish: one call per line
kill(id)

sys.watch("workspaces", function(w) … end)   -- a system service; returns whether this system has it
sys.call("workspaces.focus", 3)               -- ask a service for something
local menu = sys.ask("tray.menu", key)        -- ask it something and wait for the answer (the logic may wait)
log("whatever", 42)
tr("Good morning")                   -- the scene's `translations`, in the language `locale` says
busy(600)                                 -- fake work, to see that the renderer does not care
```

**Facts have a type**, the one the scene gave them: a yes-or-no is read and written with `true` and `false`; an enum (`fact mode: low | normal | critical`), with the name of its value; everything else, numbers. `on("fact:mode", function(m) … end)` receives the same. A value that does not exist is an error that says which ones there are: `'mode' cannot be 'critcal'. Did you mean 'critical'?`

A misspelled name is an error there and then, with a suggestion: `the scene has no fact called 'opne'. Did you mean 'open'?`

## A logic that plays

Everything above is for a logic that decides now and then. A game decides
sixty times a second: where the ball is, what it has hit, what sounds. These
are for that, and they change nothing for a logic that does not use them.

```lua
local x, vx = 240, 0
on("frame", function(dt)                  -- dt: seconds since the last one it heard of
    vx = (held("Right") and 300 or 0) - (held("Left") and 300 or 0)
    local p = pad(1)                      -- a game controller, or nil
    if p then vx += p.lx * 300 end
    x = math.clamp(x + vx * dt, 20, 460)
    fact.x = x                            -- the scene draws it there: `at: x, 260`
end)
on("key_down", function(name)
    if name == "space" then sound.tone({ wave = "square", freq = 440, to = 880, ms = 120 }) end
end)
```

**`on("frame", function(dt) … end)`** is called once for each frame, right
before it is made, with the seconds gone by since the last one it was told of
(never more than a tenth: a pause does not become a jump). The render gives it
three milliseconds to answer, and what it says in that time —a `fact`, a
`text`, a `model`— goes into that very frame: the ball is drawn where it is
now, not where it was. If it takes longer, the frame is made without waiting,
as always, and what it said shows in the next; while it has not finished with
one frame it is not told of another, and the time it missed comes in the next
`dt`. Listening to frames is what keeps them coming: a scene whose logic does
not, still rests when nothing moves. A mistake in the handler is said once and
it stops being called, until the logic is saved again.

What it moves, it moves through facts: `fact.x = 132.5`, and the scene draws
with them (`ellipse { at: x, y; radius: 9 }`). Many things at once are a
`model`, handed over whole each frame; only what changed travels.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `held("Left")` | whether that key is down right now, by the name a rule gives it (`Left`, `space`, `Escape`); a letter, in lower case whatever Shift says |
| `on("key_down", function(name) … end)` · `on("key_up", …)` | a key going down —once, however long it is held, where `on("key", …)` repeats— and coming up. Losing the keyboard lets go of all of them. The surface has to ask for the keyboard (`keyboard: on_demand`) |
| `mouse.x` · `mouse.y` | where the mouse is on the scene; `nil` when it is not over it |
| `mouse.over` · `mouse.left` · `mouse.right` · `mouse.middle` | whether it is over the scene, and which of its buttons are down |
| `pad(1)` | how the first game controller is right now, or `nil` if there is none: `name`; the sticks `lx`, `ly`, `rx`, `ry` from −1 to 1 (up is negative, like the screen); the triggers `lt`, `rt` from 0 to 1; and whether each button is down: `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `lb`, `rb`, `back`, `start`, `guide`, `ls`, `rs`, and the cross as `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`. A stick at rest rarely says exactly 0: leave it a little room (`if math.abs(p.lx) > 0.15`). With `services: "gamepad"` |
| `sys.watch("gamepad", function(pads) … end)` | every pad plugged in, as a list of those same tables: told when one arrives or goes, and when a button goes down or up (not for a stick moving: that is read each frame) |
| `hit.circles(ax, ay, ar, bx, by, br)` · `hit.boxes(ax, ay, aw, ah, bx, by, bw, bh)` · `hit.circle_box(cx, cy, r, bx, by, bw, bh)` · `hit.point(px, py, bx, by, bw, bh)` | whether two things touch. A box is said as the scene says it: its centre and its size |
| `hit.pairs(these, those)` | every pair that touches between two lists, as `{ { i, j }, … }`: each record has `x`, `y` and either `r` (a circle) or `w` and `h` (a box). Found in one go, not in a loop of the logic's |
| `hit.first(x, y, r, those)` | the first of `those` that a circle touches, or `nil` |

**Sound**, with `services: "sound"`. A file from the logic's folder (or one
inside it) —a WAV or an Ogg Vorbis—, or a tone made on the spot, which is most
of what a small game needs and wants no files:

```lua
local id = sound.play("coin.wav", { volume = 0.8, pitch = 1.2, pan = -0.5 })
local tune = sound.play("tune.ogg", { loop = true, volume = 0.4 })
sound.tone({ wave = "square", freq = 440, to = 880, ms = 120, volume = 0.5 })   -- a jump
sound.tone({ wave = "noise", freq = 900, to = 80, ms = 350, release = 300 })    -- a burst
sound.stop(tune)        -- one; sound.stop() is every one this logic started
sound.load("tune.ogg")  -- read ahead of time: a long file takes a moment the first time
sound.volume(0.6)       -- how loud everything this program plays is
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `volume` | 1 is as it is |
| `pitch` | 1 is as it is; 2, an octave up and half as long (files only) |
| `pan` | −1 all to the left, 1 all to the right |
| `loop` | it starts again when it ends, until it is stopped |
| `wave` | `sine`, `square` (the default), `saw`, `triangle`, `noise` |
| `freq` · `to` | the pitch it starts at and the one it slides to, in hertz (`to` left out, it stays) |
| `ms` · `attack` · `release` | how long it lasts, how long it takes to rise and how long to fall, in milliseconds |
| `duty` | of a square wave, how much of each turn it is up: 0.5 is even, 0.2 thin and nasal |

Everything a program plays is mixed here and goes to the sound server as one
stream (PulseAudio's protocol, which PipeWire speaks too), opened the first
time something sounds and let go after a few seconds of silence. Up to 48
things sound at once; what a logic left sounding stops when it is reloaded.
On a machine with no sound server it says so once, and nothing is heard.

## The system services

`sys.watch(name, fn)` listens to something that happens in the system. The function receives the state right now and then every change, as a table. **The names are the same on every system**; who answers is `src/platform/`'s business. If this system does not have that service, `sys.watch` returns `false` and the scene decides what to do without it.

| Service | What it reports | Who provides it today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workspaces` | `{ active = 3, list = { { id, name, windows, monitor, active }, … } }`; each one's `active` says whether it is the active one **on its monitor**, which is what a bar per screen needs | Hyprland, over its sockets (without running `hyprctl`) |
| `window` | `{ title, class, monitor }` of the one with the focus; elsewhere than Hyprland also `list = { { id, title, class, monitor, active, minimized }, … }`, every window in the order it came | Hyprland; any compositor with wlr-foreign-toplevel (pleamar-wm, sway, niri…) |
| `sys.call("workspaces.focus", n)` | go to a workspace | Hyprland |
| `sys.call("window.restore", id)` · `("window.minimize", id)` · `("window.activate", id)` · `("window.close", id)` | a window, by the `id` `window`'s `list` gives it: brought back (with the keyboard), put away, given the keyboard, asked to close | wlr-foreign-toplevel (pleamar-wm, sway, niri…) |
| `audio` | `{ volume = 0.54, muted = false, input, input_muted, outputs, inputs, apps }`: the default output and input (0..1, as the mixer shows it), the devices for each, `{ { id, name, default }, … }`, and what is playing, `apps = { { id, name, icon, binary, title, volume, muted, playing }, … }`: one per stream (a browser has one for each tab that sounds), `icon` its icon name (or its program's, in lower case, if it does not say), `title` what it plays, `playing` false while it is paused. Event sounds (a click, a notice's chime) are left out | Linux: PulseAudio's protocol spoken directly (PipeWire speaks it too), told of changes; nothing is spawned. Without a sound server to speak to, `wpctl` |
| `sys.call("audio.volume", 0.5)` · `("audio.step", -0.05)` · `("audio.mute")` · `("audio.input", 0.8)` · `("audio.input_mute")` · `("audio.default", id)` · `("audio.app_volume", id, 0.5)` · `("audio.app_mute", id[, true])` | set it, move it one step, silence it (or `("audio.mute", true)`), the same for the input, where it plays or listens (an `id` from the lists), and one application's volume or silence (an `id` from `apps`) | `apps`, `app_volume` and `app_mute` need a sound server (PulseAudio or PipeWire); with `wpctl` alone there are no `apps` |
| `battery` | `{ present, percent, charging }`; a desktop answers `{ present = false }` | Linux: `/sys/class/power_supply`, told of changes by the kernel (a charger plugged in or out shows within a second), and looked at again every 20 s |
| `brightness` | `{ present, level }`; with no backlight, `{ present = false }` | Linux: `/sys/class/backlight` |
| `sys.call("brightness.level", 0.6)` | set it | Linux: `brightnessctl`, which is who has the permission |
| `network` | `{ online, kind = "wired" \| "wifi" \| "none", name, strength, wifi, networks = { { ssid, strength, secure, known, active }, … } }`: the connection in use, whether the wifi radio is on, and the networks in range (one per name, strongest first; `known`: used before) | Linux: NetworkManager over D-Bus, told of changes; without it, the kernel (`/proc/net`, only `online`, `kind`, `name`, `strength`) |
| `sys.call("network.wifi", true)` · `("network.scan")` · `("network.connect", ssid[, password])` · `("network.disconnect")` · `("network.forget", ssid)` | the radio on or off, look for networks, join one (a known one as it was saved; a new one with its password), leave, forget a saved one | `services: "network.*"`; NetworkManager |
| `bluetooth` | `{ present, powered, discovering, devices = { { name, address, paired, connected, battery, icon }, … } }`: the first adapter and the devices it knows or sees, connected first; `battery` 0..1, or -1 if the device does not say. With no adapter, `{ present = false }` | Linux: BlueZ over D-Bus, told of changes |
| `sys.call("bluetooth.power", true)` · `("bluetooth.scan", true)` · `("bluetooth.connect", address)` · `("bluetooth.disconnect", address)` · `("bluetooth.forget", address)` | the radio, looking for devices, connecting (it pairs first if it has to, and trusts it; it takes seconds and the change arrives through the service), leaving, forgetting | `services: "bluetooth.*"`; BlueZ |
| `thumbnails` | `{ capturing, list = { { id, title, app, picture, stale }, … } }`: every window of the desktop, the scene's or not. `picture` is a small PNG of it (400 px at most), a path with a version that `image … = from` paints and reloads: empty until it is asked for. A window asked for live (`thumbnails.live`) skips the file: `picture` names its last frame, kept in memory (`thumbnails:3?12`), which `image … = from` paints at the size it is drawn (a very large one a little softer, as any live image); once it is no longer asked for live, `picture` is the PNG of that last frame. `stale`, the compositor said it stopped copying it and the picture is the last one; a window it does not copy without saying so (Hyprland, for one off every monitor) keeps its last picture all the same, not stale. A copy with the same pixels as the last one changes nothing. `capturing` false, the compositor lists its windows but cannot copy them | Linux: `ext-foreign-toplevel-list` and `ext-image-copy-capture` (pleamar-wm, Hyprland, sway, niri…); a window is copied only when it changes, a few times a second at most |
| `sys.call("thumbnails.want", ids)` · `("thumbnails.want", "all")` · `("thumbnails.want")` | which windows to copy: the ones on screen, all of them, or none (the default). Copying costs: ask for the ones shown | |
| `sys.call("thumbnails.live", ids)` · `("thumbnails.live", "all")` · `("thumbnails.live")` | which windows to copy live, for an overview that shows them moving: up to 30 times a second, and only when they change, straight to the image that draws them, at its size. The same arguments as `thumbnails.want`, and the two do not mix: a window in either is copied, live if it is in this one. A window moved between the two keeps its picture until it next changes, except that one no longer live becomes a file straight away. Live costs more: ask for the ones shown | |
| `media` | `{ playing, title, artist, album, length, position, rate, art, player }`; `length` and `position` in seconds (0 if the player does not say), `position` as of the report —carry it on at `rate` while `playing`, see the recipe *How far into the song*—, `art` the `mpris:artUrl` as given; with no players, `player = ""`; `players = { { id, name, playing, chosen }, … }`, all of them, `name` being the player's `Identity` | Linux: MPRIS over D-Bus (`zbus`), without asking every so often |
| `sys.call("media.toggle")` · `("media.next")` · `("media.previous")` · `("media.choose", id)` | to the player being reported; `media.choose` pins which one that is (an `id` from `players`), `""` lets it choose again | |
| `notifications` | `{ { id, app, title, body, icon, image, urgency, time, actions = { { key, label } } }, … }`, the newest first. `icon` is the application's; `image` the picture it brings —the sender's photo—, a file even when it arrives as pixels (`image-data`); `time` when it arrived, in seconds since 1970. There can only be one receiver: the newest shell takes them from an older one (which gets them back when it leaves); behind a daemon that will not give them up, it waits in the queue. **Returns `false` only without a session bus** | Linux: pleamar is the `org.freedesktop.Notifications` server |
| `sys.call("notifications.dismiss", id)` · `("notifications.invoke", id, "default")` · `("notifications.clear")` | dismiss, press one of its buttons (the application finds out), empty | |
| `sys.ask("auth.check", password)` | is that the password of whoever owns the session? `true` or `false`. It is what a lock screen needs to open. A wrong one takes a couple of seconds, on purpose, and the system counts it like any other failed login | `services: "auth"` |
| `sys.call("notifications.keep", true)` | they stop expiring on their own. Six seconds and gone is what a bar of bubbles wants; a notification **centre** —a tray, a history— keeps them until somebody decides, and the standard leaves that to the server. It is not only how long they show: once one is closed its application stops listening, so an expired one can no longer be opened from here | |
| `notification_history` | the same shape: the ones that went away **on their own**, unseen, newest first, the last 50 (not the ones someone closed or opened: those were seen). It lives while the process does. With `notifications.keep(true)` nothing expires, so it stays empty: then the list itself is the centre | Linux |
| `sys.call("notifications.forget", id)` · `("notifications.clear_history")` | one out of the history, or all of it | |
| `tray` | `{ { key, id, title, status, icon, menu }, … }`; `icon` is a name or a path, ready as it comes for `image … = from` | Linux: `StatusNotifierItem`. Watcher if there is no other; if there is, host to it |
| `sys.call("tray.activate", key)` · `("tray.secondary", key)` · `("tray.context", key)` · `("tray.scroll", key, 1)` | the click, the middle one, asking it to show its menu (if it knows how), the wheel | |
| `sys.ask("tray.menu", key)` → `{ { id, label, enabled, separator, checked, children }, … }` · `sys.call("tray.menu_click", key, id)` | an icon's menu, as a tree, and choosing something from it | Linux: `com.canonical.dbusmenu` |
| `apps` | `{ { name, exec, icon, id, wmclass, local_name, categories }, … }`, in alphabetical order; `id` is the `.desktop` file's name (`org.gnome.Calculator`, which is the app id its windows say) and `wmclass` its `StartupWMClass`, to tell whose a window is; `local_name` its name in the user's language (`Name[es]`: «Calculadora»; the name itself if it has none), `categories` its `Categories=` as written (`Utility;Calculator;`) | Linux: the `.desktop` files in `XDG_DATA_DIRS` (without the hidden ones or the terminal ones) |
| `sys.call("apps.launch", exec)` | launch one, loose from the program | Linux: `setsid -f sh -c` |

Whatever is not a service yet can be got out with `spawn` and `run`, but that ties the script to one system: it is a stopgap until the service exists. `bar.luau` used to read the volume that way; it no longer calls anything of Linux's.

On exit, the program stops everything the logic left running; on reloading the logic, too. And if it is killed outright, it all goes with it just the same (on Linux the kernel is asked to see to it).

## Plugins: one logic per library

A library with a `.luau` next to it is a plugin (see [Language reference — version 0.1](11-language-reference.md), §5). Its logic is a script like any other, with four differences:

- **It only sees its own.** `text.now` is the scene's `Clock.now`; `fact.secret`, if `secret` belongs to the scene, does not exist: `plugin 'Nosy' has no fact called 'secret'. A plugin only sees what its library declares`. The same with `model`, `emit` and what it listens to: `on("tapped", …)` is `Clock.tapped`, and `on("key", …)` hears nothing.
- **Its permissions are approved by whoever uses it.** `pleamar --approve scene.plm` shows what each plugin asks for and asks about it; unapproved, it runs with none (`plugin 'Clock' wants to run 'date', but nobody has approved its permissions`), and if its code or what it asks for changes, it goes back to unapproved.
- **Its permissions are the ones in its own `.plm`**, not those of the scene using it: `plugin 'Nosy' has no permission to run 'sh'. If it should be able to, declare it in its own .plm (the scene's do not count)`.
- **It does not ask for gestures or move the typing caret**: that belongs to the scene. If it wants something to happen, it emits an event of its own, and the scene decides (`on Clock.tapped { play nod }`).

Each plugin has its own Luau state —its memory, its timers, its processes— **and its own thread**: one that gets stuck does not hold back the others or the scene's logic. The scene may have no logic at all.

`require("lib/format")` loads `lib/format.luau` from that logic's folder (the scene's, or the plugin's), once; whatever it returns is the module. No `..`, no whole paths: it does not leave its folder. Saving a module reloads the logic, like saving the main file. A module shares the logic's globals (`on`, `fact`, `sys`…), not its `local`s: what it needs from the main file goes to it as an argument, `require("pages/wifi")(shared)`.

## Permissions

The sandbox closes off `io` and `os`; what stays open to the system is `run`, `spawn` and the services, and **each scene declares which ones it uses**, in its `.plm`:

```
permissions { run: "date";  services: "workspaces", "workspaces.focus", "window", "audio", "audio.*" }
```

Undeclared is nothing. **Listening is not commanding**: `"audio"` allows `sys.watch` and `sys.ask`; for `sys.call("audio.volume", …)` it takes `"audio.volume"`, or `"audio.*"` for everything in that service. A command or a service that is not there is an error there and then, which says what to write: `the scene gives no permission to run 'sh'. If it should be able to, declare it in the .plm: permissions { run: "sh" }`. It is in the scene and not in the script so that it can be read at a glance, before anything runs; it is printed at startup (`logic · permissions · commands: date · services: none`), and reloading the scene applies the new ones. `apps.launch` only launches applications the `apps` service has reported.

## The sandbox

- **No `io`, no `os.execute`**: it is Luau's `sandbox` mode. The only door to the system is `run`.
- **Memory ceiling**: 64 MB.
- **Counted seconds**: a handler that has gone more than 2 s without finishing is cut off, and the logic stays alive. Tested with a `while true do end`.
- **An error takes nothing down**: it is reported on the console and the rest of the handlers carry on.

> **`fact`, `text` and `sys` are always read there and then.** In its sandbox, Luau takes for granted that a global does not change and keeps what it read on load: `text.query` was worth `""` forever inside a handler. The compiler is told those three are mutable. It took an afternoon to find.

## Events with a payload

In the scene, `emit opened(i)`; in the logic, `on("opened", function(i) … end)`. Before, it took one event per index.

## Lists that come from data

```lua
model.rows = { { label = "Open", enabled = true }, { label = "Quit" } }     -- the whole list, at once
local r = model.rows[i + 1]                                                 -- and it reads back just as it was put in
```

The scene declares the shape (`model rows max 14 { label: text; enabled: bool = true }`) and walks it (`for r in rows`). From each record the declared fields are taken and the rest is ignored, so **a service's list is handed over as it comes**: `sys.watch("tray", function(list) model.icons = list end)`. Whatever is missing is worth its default value; a `bool` is written with `true` and `false`, an enum with the name of its value (or its number), and an inner list (`list items`) with another table, which is handed out the same way; and where a number is expected, a list counts as how many it holds (`children: number` with a submenu inside). Only what has changed since the previous time travels to the renderer. **The assignment is atomic**: if one record is wrong, it is an error and the list that was there stays as it was.

Reading it back gives the original table, with everything it carried (`model.icons[1].key`), not just the scene's fields: it is where the logic keeps what the scene does not need to see.

## Cross-platform
