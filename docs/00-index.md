# pleamar — Index

**What it is:** a desktop runtime —what would be "a better Quickshell"— and the language its scenes are written in. Born on 19 Sep 2026 out of a conversation about why QtQuick cannot animate while the logic works.

**Where it lives:** [github.com/k4ditano/pleamar](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar). These notes travel with the program too: `pleamar --docs` prints the ones of the version installed.

## Start here

| Note | What for |
| --- | --- |
| [The guide](guide.md) | From zero to a bar, step by step |
| [Recipes](recipes.md) | Whole scenes that already work, ready to copy |
| [Language reference — version 0.6](11-language-reference.md) | **The reference**: lexicon, EBNF grammar, every element with what it accepts, and the version number. Its examples are compiled by `./run-tests.sh`, and its vocabulary is compared against the compiler's |
| [The logic, in Luau](10-luau-logic.md) | The boundary seen from the logic: what a `.luau` can do, and its sandbox |
| [Scenes an agent can read](12-agents.md) | The scene as a tree, acting by name, `wait`, and `agent: no` |

| [Known limitations](08-limitations.md) | Everything that is half-done, with its severity and its plan; and, below, everything fixed, with its date |

## Where it stands (pleamar 0.6.0, 31 Oct 2026)

- **The renderer animates on its own**: with the logic blocked for 600 ms, 38 frames at ~17 ms. The same trial in QML: a 600 ms gap. And a round of a big scene costs what changed in it, not how big it is (0.5).
- **The language, version 0.6**: scenes, components with typed parameters and slots, `repeat` and `for`, layouts with `grow:`, `wrap:`, `view:` and grids, layers, gestures, rules, enums, arrays and sorting, texts with slots, translations, imports and libraries. Checked on load, with «did you mean…?», and written down in the reference.
- **The logic in Luau**, in a sandbox, on its own thread, behind permissions; **plugins** with their own boundary, thread and permissions, approved by whoever uses them.
- **Drawing**: blended shapes with shadow, rim and light, gradients, paths, svgs as geometry, glass that bends what is behind it, group effects, particles and the scene's own WGSL shaders.
- **The system**: audio, battery, brightness, network, bluetooth, media, notifications and their history, tray, windows and their thumbnails, workspaces, apps, files, clock and polkit — named in the scene and filled.
- **Surfaces**: panels on any layer-shell compositor, one per monitor with its own state, popups, plain windows and lock screens.
- **For whoever writes it**: hot reload that loses nothing, a language server, highlighting for vim and VS Code, types for luau-lsp, `--report` to measure on someone else's machine, and a skill that teaches AI agents to write and check scenes.
- **[pleamar-wm](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar-wm)**: a compositor whose window manager is a pleamar scene, with hands for AI agents.
- ⬜ Still missing: copies born at runtime, deferred loading, IME, and a whole screen live inside the scene. See the next step.

Every version, with what it brought: [Releases](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar/releases).

## Next step

**The direction:** this is **an alternative to Quickshell**, not the engine of one particular shell. The yardstick is [Parity with Quickshell](07-whats-missing.md), measured against real configurations, and its §4 says the order of work: copies that are born and die on their own (G12) and inertia in lists, then deferred loading, then IME. **Still to be tried by real hands**: the popups and the tray menu (S11), the input field with a real keyboard (E8), the wheel (E1), and notifications and the tray as the only bar (B12, B14).
