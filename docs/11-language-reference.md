# Language reference — version 0.1

**What this note is.** The complete, exact description of what the language accepts. [The language — the guide](09-language-v0.md) is the guide —read straight through, with the reason behind each thing—; this is where a doubt gets looked up. It comes from the compiler (`src/language/`), not from memory, and **it cannot fall behind without `./run-tests.sh` saying so**: its whole examples compile, and its vocabulary (§17) is compared against the one the compiler consults.

```sh
pleamar --version                  # pleamar 0.2.34 · language 0.3
pleamar --check scene.plm      # reads it, with whatever it imports; says whether it is fine, exits
./run-tests.sh                        # tests/*.plm, examples/*.plm and the examples in this note
```

## 1. Version

The language has a number of its own, apart from the program's: **0.3**. The first changes when something already written stops being valid; the second, when something is added. A file can say which one it needs, on its first line:

```
language 0.1
```

If it asks for a different first number, or a second one higher than the program understands, it is an error on load —`this file asks for language 0.7, and this pleamar understands 0.3`— and not a half-built scene. A file that asks for 0.1 is still read by 0.3: what 0.2 added —a group's own `shader:`, workspaces, `pick`, `import … as`, `drag.over`— and what 0.3 added —what a zone tells an agent: `label:`, `agent:`, `role:`, `value:`, `checked:`, `selected:`— it simply does not use. Without that line, it is read with whatever is there. While the first is 0, nothing is promised: this is a language still being made.

## 2. What it guarantees

It is a **declarative language that always terminates**. No free loops, no recursion, no variables that mutate: `repeat` and `for` unfold on load, with a ceiling. Everything written is run by the renderer, on its own, at the cadence of the screen; the logic (Luau, apart) only sets facts, texts, models and events. **Every name is checked on load**: a misspelt one is an error with its file, its line, its arrow and a "did you mean…?", never a failure while running.

## 3. Lexicon

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Comment | `//` to the end of the line |
| End of statement | a newline or `;`. Inside parentheses, a newline ends nothing |
| Name | letters, digits, `_` and `.`; starts with a letter or `_`. Dots are part of the name: `orb.x`, `note.0.title`. Inside a `repeat`, `$i` is replaced by the number of the turn: `hit.$i` |
| Number | `40`, `0.5`, `-3`. With a unit: `40px` (= 40), `34%` (= 0.34), `138deg` (to radians) |
| Duration | `320ms`, `14s`. Where a duration is expected, a number without a unit is not valid |
| Color | `#151616` or `#fff` |
| Text | `"in quotes"`. With slots, see §11 |
| Symbols | `{ } ( ) , : ; = ~ + - * / < > <= >= == != .. -> % \|` |

Words of the language (they cannot be used as a name of one's own without confusing the reader, though the compiler does not forbid it): `language import scene library surface permissions model service spring prop pose fact event text image measure let zone body ellipse box arc line path input clip group popup component repeat for row column space layer on every blink wave spin follow look gesture posture`, and inside their statements `in max while for after from until at by reach within rest every inset right middle move curve close via as radial radius to change wrap true false and or not`.

## 4. Grammar

In EBNF: `[ x ]` is optional, `{ x }` zero or more times, `|` alternatives, `"x"` literally. `end` is a newline or `;`.

`Name` in `copy` is that of an already declared component: by convention capitalised, which is what tells it apart at a glance from a statement of the language.

## 5. Files, order and names

**A file is a scene or a library.** A scene is opened; a library is imported. `import "path.plm"` goes before `scene` or `library`, and the path is relative **to the file that imports it**. A library imported by two routes is read once; a circle is an error that says its route. A library only declares: `let`, `spring` and `component`. What is imported behaves as if it were written at the start of the scene.

**`import "menu.plm" as menu`** gives the library's components a surname: from the scene they are `menu.Row(r)`, and inside the library they keep calling each other by their own names (`Row` inside `menu.Pair` is `menu.Row`). That is how two libraries that each have a `Row` are used together. A library has one name in a scene: imported once with `as menu` and again with `as other`, or without it, is an error. The surname is for components; a library's facts, texts and events already live under the library's name (`Menu.open`), and its `let`s and springs are still shared, so the scene can override a colour.

**A big scene goes in pieces with `include`.** `include "pages/wifi.plm"` puts there, where the line is, what a **part** holds —`part Wifi { … }`, in a file of its own—, as if it had been written there: the same names (a part's `fact` is the scene's, and it reads the scene's lets, and those of the group it is included in), the same order (it paints where it is included). It can go inside a `group`, and a part can include others; its path is relative to the file that includes it. A part does not import: the scene imports the libraries, and its parts use them. Its errors say its own file and line, what it draws finds its images next to it, and saving it reloads the scene like any of its files. A part is not opened: `pleamar --check` on one says so. Unlike a library it has no name of its own to live under; it is the same scene, in more files.

```
scene Marea {
    include "pages/declarations.plm"
    group {
        let lx = card.x - 228
        include "pages/wifi.plm"       // part Wifi { … }, which reads lx
    }
}
```

**`library Name strict { … }`**: its components can only read what they ask for by parameter, what they declare themselves, what belongs to their library (and to whatever it imports), and the names that always exist. Reading a fact, a color or an event of the scene without asking for it is an error on load —`'Nosy' belongs to a `strict` library and reads 'secret', which is the scene's, without asking for it`—: that way someone else's library does not depend on what things are called in the scene, nor does it touch them. Without `strict`, a component sees everything belonging to whoever uses it, which is the comfortable thing for one's own libraries.

**A plugin is a library with its logic next to it**: `clock.plm` and `clock.luau`. It can also declare its own boundary —`fact`, `text`, `model`, `event`— and its `permissions`:

```
library Clock strict {
    permissions { run: "date" }           // ITS logic's, not the scene's
    text now = "--:--"
    fact seconds = false
    event tapped ->
    component Clock(tone: color = ink) {
        row face { padding: 9; fill: coal; corner: 14;  text now { size: 14; color: tone } }
        on press face { emit tapped }
    }
}
```

- Its boundary **lives under the name of the library**: inside it is written `now`; from the scene, `Clock.now`. Two plugins can each have their own `count`, and neither treads on the scene's.
- Its logic runs in **its own Luau state**, and there `text.now` is `Clock.now`: it cannot name —cannot read, write or emit— anything that is not its own, neither the scene's nor another plugin's. It does not hear the keyboard, or the mouse, or anybody else's events; it does not ask for gestures or move the writing cursor.
- What it touches of the system is set by **its** `permissions`. The scene's are no good to it, and its own are no good to the scene. On start-up this is printed: `logic  · plugin 'Clock' · permissions · commands: date · services: none`.
- A scene may have no logic of its own and use plugins that do. Saving a plugin's `.plm` or `.luau` reloads hot, like everything else.

Asking for permissions without a `.luau` next to it is an error: there is nobody to use them.

**A plugin's permissions are approved by whoever uses it.** Declaring them is not having them: `pleamar --approve scene.plm` shows what each plugin of that scene asks for, and asks. What is approved is stored outside the plugin, with the fingerprint of its logic and of what it asked for: if either of the two changes, it goes back to unapproved. **Unapproved, a plugin runs with no permissions at all**, and its errors say why and how to approve it. An interpreter (`sh`, `python`…) comes out flagged: it is asking for everything. The scene one opens does not go through this: opening it is already deciding.

A library can also bring **what moves inside** —`prop`, `pose`, `gesture`, `posture`, `layer`— and **images and figures** (`image logo = file "logo.png", 16, 16`, `figure hat = file "hat.svg"`: the path is relative to the file that writes it, so the piece travels with it). All under its name, like its boundary. What it cannot do is draw outside a component, or hold loose rules: that belongs to the scene.

**The scene talks to a plugin by emitting one of its events** (`on press button { emit Face.cheer }`), which the plugin's components hear (`on cheer { … }`) and its logic too (`on("cheer", …)`); and it can read and set the facts of its boundary (`Face.happy = false`): the scene is the owner. A plugin has no surface of its own: if something needs one, it is a scene.

**The file is read in four passes** —declarations; `let` and layers; drawing; rules—, so the order of what is written is whatever suits the reader: a rule can come before the shape it names, and a `prop` at the end. Two exceptions: a `let` has to come before whoever uses it, and **things are painted in the order they are written** (and of two zones, the one declared later ends up on top).

**Every name is global**, except inside a component or inside one turn of a `repeat` or a `for`: there, what is declared belongs to that copy (two copies of `Note` each have their own `lit` and their own `hit` zone), and the inner things are looked up first —parameters, the component's `let`— and then the outer ones. A `let` of the scene with the name of an imported one treads on it: that is how a tone is changed. Two components with the same name do not coexist. **A `group` does not keep its `let`s**: one written inside a group is seen by everything after it, outside too, so a group's `let` with the name of one written outside any group is an error (it would have changed that one in everything below). It is so too when they are in different parts, or in a scene copied per monitor. Inside a component, a `repeat` or a `for` the `let` is theirs.

**Names that always exist**, read like facts: `screen.width`, `screen.height` (what the real surface measures), `screen.index` (which monitor copy this is, with `screens: each`; 0 otherwise), and during a rule, the mouse's: `pointer.x`, `pointer.y` (on the surface), `local.x`, `local.y` (inside the zone), `drag.dx`, `drag.dy` (since the press), `wheel` (notches; positive is upwards). And the `demo` event, which `--demo` fires.

**`cursor.x`, `cursor.y` are the mouse wherever it is**: over another window, on
another monitor, far from the scene. They are in the scene's own coordinates,
like `pointer.x`, so a pair of eyes computes the same way whether the mouse is
over them or across the desk: `atan2(cursor.y - cy, cursor.x - cx)`. A surface
on Wayland is not told where the mouse is when it is not over it —on purpose—,
so pleamar asks whoever knows, and **only if the scene names them**: on
Hyprland, its socket, about thirty times a second; in a pleamar-wm session,
the `cursor.sock` it keeps for its programs, which says the mouse as it
moves. Elsewhere they are the pointer's while it is over the scene, and keep
their last value when it leaves.

A named surface draws from its own corner, so it has its own pair:
**`nook.cursor.x`, `nook.cursor.y`** are the same mouse in the coordinates the
surface `nook` draws with. That is what a camera in a corner needs to point at
the mouse: `atan2(nook.cursor.y - cy, nook.cursor.x - cx)`.

```plm
scene Watching {
    surface { size: 120, 120 }
    prop gaze.x = 0 ~gentle
    prop gaze.y = 0 ~gentle
    //  With the mouse near, the eyes follow it; far, they rest looking at it.
    let far = max(length(cursor.x - 60, cursor.y - 60), 1)
    look gaze.x, gaze.y at 60, 60 reach 6, 4 within 200 rest 6 * (cursor.x - 60) / far, 4 * (cursor.y - 60) / far
    ellipse { at: 60 + gaze.x, 60 + gaze.y; radius: 8; color: #f5f7f5 }
}
```

## 6. Declarations

| Statement | What it declares |
| --- | --- |
| `surface { … }` · `surface panel { …; …drawing… }` | The windows it asks for. See below |
| `permissions { run: "date"; services: "audio", "audio.*" }` | What the logic may touch of the system. Undeclared, nothing. **Listening is not commanding**: `"audio"` allows knowing the volume (`sys.watch`, `sys.ask`); changing it needs `"audio.volume"`, or `"audio.*"` |
| `service clock as now { time: text; hour: number }` | A system service, by its name. Whatever it reports fills `now.time` and `now.hour` **without a line of logic**. See below |
| `model rows max 14 { label: text; enabled: bool = true; depth: number }` | A list of records that the logic fills. `max`: how many fit (1 to 256; 16 if unsaid). Creates `rows.count`, `rows.total` and, per record, `rows.K.field` |
| `prop orb.x = 360 ~lively` | An animated property: a spring. Without `~`, `lively` |
| `pose eyes = 14` | A property of the pose: the kind a gesture leads by the hand |
| `fact open = false` · `fact tries: number = 3` · `fact mode: low \| normal \| critical = normal` | Something that is true for a while. The logic and the rules set it. See **Types**, below |
| `event confirmed` · `event view_event ->` | Something that happens. With `->`, it also reaches the logic |
| `text notice.title = "Meeting"` | A live text: the logic changes it, or an `input` |
| `image fox = icon "firefox", 48, 48` | An image, and the largest logical size it is painted at. `icon "name"`, `file "path"`, or `from some_text`: whichever that text says (an icon name, or a path if it starts with `/`). A `file` that moves —a **GIF, an animated PNG or an animated WebP**— plays by itself, looping; the render wakes up only when it changes frame, it stops while the image is not seen, and with reduced motion it stays on its first frame. Its frames go to the atlas at the size it is painted, up to a quarter of it: one that asks for more keeps one frame in two —or three…—, at the same pace. **The declared size fixes the shape of the image's cell**: the picture is fitted inside a box of that shape, keeping its proportions, and that box is then stretched to the `size:` it is drawn at. Declare it with the proportions it is drawn at, or a picture of another shape is squashed, or leaves empty bands |
| `figure hat = file "hat.svg"` | An svg **as geometry**: its layers become paths, each one named by the `id` of its group in the file. The path is relative to the file that writes it, so a library takes its pieces with it |
| `shader aurora = file "aurora.wgsl"` | One of the scene's **own shaders**: a function in WGSL that paints a box, point by point. It is read and checked when the scene is read, and touching the file reloads it, like an svg. How it is written, in §8.1 |
| `measure label` | Creates `label.width` and `label.height`, filled by the text that carries `measure: label` |
| `let panel.x = orb.x + 62` · `let mint = #9ed6bd` | A name for an expression, or for a color. A small one is substituted where it is named; **a big one is computed once a frame** and what is named is that, so a chain of them —each naming the one before— costs a sum and not a product |
| `spring bouncy = 170, 12` | A spring of one's own: stiffness, damping. From the house: `lively`, `calm`, `quick`, `slow`, `gentle`, `pose`. Inline: `~spring(170, 12)`, or **`~620ms`**: the spring that gets there in that long without overshooting |
| `zone box whole { at: …; size: …; active: expr }` | A zone that is not painted |

**The header says what it is; the block, what it holds.** A declaration's header names the thing and gives the few words that shape it: which one it is (`service clock`), what it is called (`as now`), how many fit (`max 8`), how deep it goes (`depth 3`). Its block holds what it contains: **fields** when it describes data —in a `model` or a `service`, `title: text` is a field called `title` that holds text—, **properties** when it sets something up, as in a `surface`, a `state` or a `zone`. So an option never takes the name of a field: a model can have one called `max` or `type`. And `windows win max 6` or `list children max 6 depth 3`, which have no block, say all they need in the header.

**Several windows in one process.** `surface { … }` with no name is the scene's, and draws whatever is loose. With a name, `surface panel { … }` is one of several and **carries inside it what it draws**:

```
surface { size: full, 40; anchor: top; screens: all }
box knob { … }
on press knob { toggle open }

surface panel {
    size: 300, 160;  anchor: top_right;  margin: 48, 12, 0, 0;  level: overlay
    open: open                                   // it is there while that is true: a fact, or any expression
    body { … };  box close { … }
    on press close { open = false }
}
```

They all **share properties, facts, models and rules**: a bar and its panel talk through a fact, without a round trip through the system and without knowing about each other. Inside, each one looks at a different slice of the same plane, just like a popup. A closed surface is not seen and cannot be pressed. `open:` takes any expression, so a surface can stay while what it holds finishes leaving: `open: tuck > 0.01`, with `tuck` a spring, closes the window once the thing has slid out of it and not before. **A named surface starts clean**: a loose `clip` of the scene ends where a named surface begins, instead of reaching into another window.

**A surface does not grow with what it draws**, and a shadow counts: `shadow: 0, 18, 44` reaches 62 px below its shape, so a card that ends 20 px from the bottom edge has its shadow cut there, and the cut is a straight line where a fade should be. Declare the surface with that room; the input region lets the click through the empty part, so nothing is lost by declaring it large. When a shape that is well clear of an edge has its shadow cut against it, the renderer says so, once, as soon as nothing is moving:

```
render · a shadow is cut: it needs 30 px below more than this 760 x 520 surface has. The shape fits; its shadow does not
render · this scene does not keep up: 32.3 ms a frame against the 16.7 the screen gives, and 31.0 of those go in reading the scene, not in drawing it
render · a drawing is cut: it needs 36 px below more than this 820 x 580 surface has. Almost all of it is inside, so it looks like the surface is the one that fell short
```

The second one is for the shape itself, which is what happens when a panel grows
past what its surface has. It is only said of what **almost** fitted —three
quarters of it inside, so a shape that hangs off an edge on purpose is left
alone— and never of an edge the surface is anchored to, where there is no room
to ask for. It waits until it has been cut for three seconds, or until nothing
is moving: crossing an edge on the way somewhere is not a layout mistake.

**Types.** For the renderer everything is numbers; types are for whoever writes and for whoever talks to the scene from outside. A fact is a number, a yes or no (`bool`; with no type, that is what one born `true` or `false` is) or an **enum**: `fact mode: low | normal | critical = normal`. The names of its values are valid in any expression (`mode == critical`, `mode = low` in a rule) and they are their position: `low` is 0. **An enum is compared against its own values, and the compiler checks it**: `mode == fast`, if `fast` belongs to another one, is an error that says which ones are valid; and arithmetic is not done with an enum (`mode + 1` means nothing; with a yes or no it does: `r.separator * 21`). The same name can be in two enums: compared against its fact, each one is its own; on its own, if it means different numbers, it is an error that asks for the long form, `mode.normal`, which is always valid. In a slot of a text, an enum is shown by its name: `"mode: {mode}"` → `mode: critical`. The logic reads and writes them as what they are —`fact.open` is `true`, `fact.mode` is `"critical"`—, and so does `--say`.

The fields of a model have those types and two more: **`image w, h`** —an icon name or a path, and the image that says: `image r.icon { … }` without declaring anything else— and **`list`**, records inside the record:

```
model menu max 8 {
    label: text
    icon: image 20, 20
    kind: plain | checked | danger = plain
    list items max 6 { label: text; enabled: bool = true }
}
for m in menu { …  for it in m.items { text it.label { … } } }
```

**A file that is written again under the same name** —a cover, a capture, a picture made for the moment— is asked for with a version: `"/tmp/cover.jpg?3"`, whatever follows the last `?` being a number. Each new number loads the file again **into the place the last one had** in the atlas, so changing it a thousand times costs the same as once; a new name, instead, takes new room. An image asked for bigger than a quarter of the atlas (2048² real pixels) is loaded smaller —a wallpaper at a monitor's size comes out softer, not missing—.

An inner list is walked with `for it in m.items`, and it has its `m.items.count` and its `m.items.total`. **`list children max 6 depth 2`**, with no block, are records like the outer one, nested inside each other down to that depth (1 to 6): a tree, like the menu of an application. It is walked with as many `for` as levels are to be shown. Everything unfolds on load: 8 × 6 is 48 records, and the ceiling across all the lists of a model is 4096.

**Services, with no logic.** `service` asks the system for something by its name and says which of the fields that service brings it wants. Each field is an ordinary fact or text —of whatever type it is given— with the name in front, and it fills itself whenever the system reports something:

```
permissions { services: "clock" }                      // without permission it is not set up
service clock { time: text = "--:--"; date: text }     // without `as`: clock.time, clock.date
service clock.seconds as tick { second: number }       // with `as`: tick.second
text clock.time { size: 14; color: ink }
```

What each service brings is in the vocabulary (§17), and **asking it for what it does not have is an error on load**, with its "did you mean…?". What the numbers mean:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `audio.volume` | 0 to 1 |
| `battery.percent` | 0 to 100 |
| `brightness.present` · `brightness.level` | the screen's backlight, 0 to 1. A machine with none says `present = false` |
| `network.strength` | 0 to 100 |
| `clock.hour` · `minute` · `second` · `day` · `month` · `year` | as they are read |
| `clock.weekday` | 0 is Sunday |
| `clock.time` · `clock.date` | already written out: `10:41`, `Sun 20 Sep` |
| `audio.input` · `audio.input_muted` | the microphone: the same two, for what comes in |
| `network.kind` | `none`, `wired` or `wifi` |
| the `bool` ones | `muted`, `charging`, `present`, `online`, `playing` |
 Whatever does not come in a report stays as it was.

**Lists, into a model, with no logic.** What a service reports as a list goes
into a model the scene declares **before** it, record by record and by field
name —as `model.x = …` would from the logic—: its field takes the model's name
as its type. For the services that are only a list —`apps`, `tray`,
`notifications`, `notification_history`— the field is `list`:

```
model nets max 12 { ssid: text; strength: number; known: bool; active: bool }
service network as net { online: bool; networks: nets }

model icons max 12 { key: text; title: text; icon: image 18, 18 }
service tray { list: icons }
```

| service | its lists |
| --- | --- |
| `network` | `networks`: `{ ssid, strength, secure, known, active }`, the strongest first |
| `bluetooth` | `devices`: `{ name, address, paired, connected, battery, icon }` |
| `audio` | `outputs` · `inputs`: `{ id, name, default }`; `apps`: `{ id, name, icon, binary, title, volume, muted, playing }`, what is playing, one per stream |
| `media` | `players`: `{ id, name, playing, chosen }`, by bus name |
| `window` | `list`: `{ id, title, class, monitor, active, minimized }` (compositors with wlr-foreign-toplevel) |
| `workspaces` | `list`: `{ id, name, windows, monitor, active }` |
| `apps` | `list`: `{ name, exec, icon, id, wmclass, local_name, categories }` |
| `tray` | `list`: `{ key, id, title, status, icon, menu }` |
| `notifications` | `list`: `{ id, app, title, body, icon, image, urgency, time, actions }` |
| `notification_history` | `list`: the same records, the ones that expired unseen, newest first, the last 50 |

The model only gets the fields it declares; the rest of each record is left
out. `nets.count` is how many fit, `nets.total` how many came.

**Which speaker and which microphone.** `outputs` and `inputs`, above: each one
`{ id, name, default }`. `sys.call("audio.default", id)` switches to one, and the
report comes back with the new `default` set. A desktop sound panel needs this:
without it only the volume of whatever was already there can be moved.

**Which player.** `media` reports one player: the one playing; if none is, the one that played last (a pause does not move it); before anything has played, the first.
`players`, above, is all of them, and `name` is what each calls itself, which
tells two phones through KDE Connect apart where `player` cannot.
`sys.call("media.choose", id)` pins one: it is reported, and `media.toggle`,
`next` and `previous` go to it, while it is there; `sys.call("media.choose", "")`
goes back to that default. The choice is the process's, not the scene's.
`playerctld` is left out: it only mirrors another player.

**Saying goodbye.** `session` is commands only —it reports nothing— and it is
what a desktop needs to close itself: `sys.call("session.lock")`, `"suspend"`,
`"logout"`, `"reboot"`, `"poweroff"`, behind `services: "session.*"`. The
permission matters more here than anywhere else, and for a different reason:
**these do not undo**. The worst an `audio.volume` can do is deafen you for a
second. Underneath they are `loginctl` and `systemctl`.

The permissions are the scene's, and they are the same as `sys.watch`'s: `services: "clock"`. Without them the scene loads all the same, says why on the console and that field stays as it was born. `clock` reports when the minute changes and `clock.seconds` every second; neither of the two asks anybody for the time nor wakes the machine up to see whether it is time yet.

**Files.** A scene has **its own folder**, and does not leave it: no paths, no `..`, like `require`. It is used from the logic, with permission `services: "files"` to read and `"files.write"` to write:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `sys.ask("files.read", "settings.json")` | whatever it says, or `nil` if it is not there |
| `sys.ask("files.read", n, "json")` | that same thing, already as a table. If the file is broken, it is an error with its place, not a half table |
| `sys.ask("files.exists", n)` · `sys.ask("files.list")` · `sys.ask("files.folder")` | whether it is there · what is there · where |
| `sys.call("files.write", n, text)` · `sys.call("files.remove", n)` | write (all or nothing: first alongside, then into place) · remove |
| `sys.call("files.write", n, { tone = 2 })` | a table is saved as JSON, with its newlines: what is saved can also be read by hand |
| `sys.watch("files:settings.txt", f)` | reports when that file changes, including when somebody else touches it |

**The environment and the clipboard**, with their permissions (`services: "env"`, `"clipboard"`, `"clipboard.set"` to write):

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `sys.ask("env", "HOME")` | an environment variable, or `nil` |
| `sys.ask("clipboard")` | whatever has been copied, as text |
| `sys.call("clipboard.set", t)` | copy that. On Wayland, whoever copies has to stay alive: the platform takes care of that |

A plugin has its own, under its name: what it saves the scene does not see, nor the other way round.

**One per monitor.** `screens: each [max N]` repeats the surface on every monitor (4 at most, unless said otherwise), and **each copy has its own**: its properties, its zones and its rules. Inside:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `$screen` | its number, to interpolate into a name: `mon.$screen.active`, like `$i` in a `repeat` |
| `screen.index` | the same, as a number |
| `screen.name` | the name of **its** monitor, set by the renderer (`HDMI-A-1`) |
| `screen.width` · `screen.height` | what **its** monitor measures |
| `screens.count` | how many monitors are showing something |

With the scene's surface (the one with no name), what is repeated is the loose drawing. `--screen A,B` spreads the copies across those monitors, which is how two are rehearsed without having two.

Its loose `prop`s and `fact`s, though, are **one for all the copies**: they are not drawing. So what a `follow` follows must not depend on which copy it is —`follow a = screen.index` ends up as the last copy's in every one—; say which monitor shows something in its `show:` instead, which is drawing and is read per copy.

```
surface { size: full, 44; anchor: top; screens: each }
model mon max 4 { active: number = 1; title: text }     // one record per monitor, from the logic
text mon.$screen.title { … }
repeat i in 1..10 { Desk(i, mon.$screen.active) { show: ws.$i.there } }
```

**An ordinary window.** `kind: window` asks for a window with its frame and its cross, one of those the compositor places, instead of a panel stuck to an edge; `title:` is what it shows. What belongs to a panel —`anchor`, `level`, `reserve`, `screens`, `margin`— is no good to it, and **`screen.width` and `screen.height` are what it measures**, not its monitor: they change when somebody stretches it, so a window is drawn against them.

```
surface { size: 460, 320;  kind: window;  title: "pleamar · settings" }
box { from: 0, 0;  size: screen.width, screen.height;  color: coal }
```

**`surface`**: `size: width, height` (`full` as the width is the whole monitor, and as the height too: `size: full, full` is all of it; a named surface publishes what it really measures as `name.width` and `name.height`, which with `full` is the only way to know it) · `kind:` `panel` `window` `lock` · `title:` (a window only) · `anchor:` `top` `bottom` `left` `right` `top_left` `top_right` `bottom_left` `bottom_right` `center` — or **the name of a fact whose values are anchors** (`fact corner: top_left | top_right = top_right`, `anchor: corner`), and then it moves from edge to edge while it runs, without being recreated · `margin: n` or `top, right, bottom, left` · `level:` `background` `bottom` `top` `overlay` — or two, **`level: top, overlay while open`**: the first as a rule, the second while that holds, changed on the fly (a panel above the rest while it has something open, so a full-screen catcher can sit under it; in its place the rest of the time, so a full-screen video still covers it) · `reserve: n` (the room windows leave it; a surface `size: full, full` anchored to one edge keeps it too —a bar and its panels on one surface as tall as the monitor—: it sticks to that edge and the two across it, not to all four, where the compositor would ignore any reserve), or **`reserve: n while expr`**, only while that holds (a shell that lets you choose whether windows go under it or leave it its strip) · `rate: 60` (at most that many frames a second, on any monitor: what a scene costs is then the same on a 60 Hz screen and on a 165 Hz one; without it, the monitor's) · `screens: all` or `"HDMI-A-1", "DP-3"` · `captures:` `shown` `hidden` (hidden: seen on the monitor but left out of what is captured of it —a screenshot, a recording, a shared screen, a remote desktop—, for what is meant only for whoever sits in front of it; pleamar-wm does it, other compositors show it in captures too) · `agent: hidden` (what it holds is left out of what the scene tells an agent: §13, *Told to an agent*) · `keyboard:` `none` `on_demand` `exclusive`, and with `while expr` it only asks for it while that is true. With `on_demand` the compositor hands the keyboard over on a click; so when the scene does `focus` on a field without having the keyboard —a search opened from a shortcut, which nobody clicked— it is asked for as `exclusive` for as long as the `while` holds, and let go when it stops: that is how a launcher behaves, and Esc closing it is what gives it back.

**A lock screen: `kind: lock`.** It is not a surface painted over everything: it is `ext-session-lock`, where the *compositor* guarantees that nothing else is seen or touched while it lasts, on every monitor. So it does not exist until its `open:` is true —which is mandatory: without it the session would be locked from the start— and it goes when `open:` stops being true. Its `size:` is the box that gets centred on each monitor; what lies around it shows too, so paint the backdrop large. `lock.held`, a name that always exists, is 1 once the compositor **confirms** the session is locked: a drawn padlock certifies nothing, this does. The password goes in an `input` with `secret: true` and is checked by the logic, `sys.ask("auth.check", text.password)`. It has one copy per monitor, and its `name.width` and `name.height` are the **largest** of them, each way: a backdrop that big, centred on the box, covers every monitor, a portrait one beside a landscape one included. `screens:` puts it only on those monitors (`screens: "DP-2"`): the protocol still wants every monitor covered, so the others get plain black, and the pointer over them touches nothing. If none of those is plugged in, it goes on all of them: a lock with nowhere to type the password would be no way back.

```plm
language 0.1
scene Lock {
    surface { size: 200, 50; anchor: top }
    fact locked = false
    surface screen_lock {
        kind: lock
        size: 600, 300
        open: locked
        box { from: -4000, -4000; size: 8600, 8300; color: #101214 }
        text "locked" { at: 300, 140; anchor: center; size: 26; color: #ffffff; opacity: lock.held }
    }
    box lock_it { at: 100, 25; size: 180, 36; corner: 12; color: #9ed6bd; cursor: pointer }
    on press lock_it { locked = true }
    on still locked for 5s while locked { locked = false }
}
```

If whoever locks dies with the lock held, the session **stays locked**. That is on purpose —the opposite would mean killing the locker unlocks— and it is the reason to try a lock screen inside a nested compositor first, never against a live session.

## 7. Expressions

They are numbers. **True is more than 0.5**; `true` is 1 and `false` is 0. The renderer evaluates them, on every frame that needs it.

From weakest to strongest: `or` · `and` · `not` · `< > <= >= == !=` (they do not chain: `a < b < c` is not valid) · `+ -` · `* /` · `-` in front. `==` means "equal to within a thousandth": these are numbers with a decimal point, and a spring never quite arrives.

| Function | |
| --- | --- |
| `min(a, b)` `max(a, b)` `abs(x)` | |
| `floor(x)` `ceil(x)` | to the integer below or the one above |
| `sin(deg)` `cos(deg)` | sine and cosine, **in degrees, as a plain number**: what it takes to put something on an arc. Animate the angle and not the x and the y, and the thing travels along the arc instead of cutting across it. `sin(30deg)` is an error: `deg` turns a number into radians, which is what `rotate` and `span` want —and so `atan2(…) * 1deg` is how an angle worked out here turns something— |
| `clamp(x, a, b)` | x, between a and b |
| `smooth(a, b, x)` | from 0 to 1 while x goes from a to b, easing in and out |
| `mix(a, b, t)` | between a and b. Also between two colors |
| `if(cond, a, b)` | a if the condition holds, b if not: only that side is evaluated. With a spring as the condition (`if(hot, a, b)`), it goes between the two, like `mix(b, a, hot)`. Also with two colors: `if(urgent, amber, mint)` |
| `vel(prop)` | the velocity of a spring, which only the renderer knows |
| `sqrt(x)` `pow(a, b)` `exp(x)` `log(x)` | square root (of 0 or more), power, e to the x, natural logarithm. A power that would not be a number (`pow(-8, 0.5)`) is 0 |
| `tan(deg)` `atan2(y, x)` | tangent, and the angle of the point (x, y): **in degrees**, like `sin` and `cos`. `atan2(pointer.y - cy, pointer.x - cx)` is where the mouse is, seen from (cx, cy) |
| `length(x, y)` | how long the vector (x, y) is: `length(pointer.x - cx, pointer.y - cy)` is how far the mouse is |
| `pick(i, a, b, c…)` | the one at place `i` (0 is the first; rounded, and kept within the list). With an enum fact it reads as a table: `pick(mode, 40, 150, 260)`. It also chooses **colours** —`color: pick(mode, #9ed6bd, #f0b85a, #ef7a66)`— and **texts** —`text pick(skin, "Liquid", "Light liquid", "Classic")`, each one translated like any other, or the name of a live text—: one text instead of three with `show:` |
| `rgb(r, g, b)` | a **colour** from three numbers, 0 to 1 each, any of which can be a fact or a property: `let ink = rgb(pal_r, pal_g, pal_b)`. Where `mix` and `pick` choose among colours the scene already has, this one lets the logic hand over a colour that did not exist when the scene was read (a palette taken from the wallpaper), by setting three facts, without a file to rewrite and a scene to reload. Only as a colour: it is not a number |
| `fract(x)` `mod(a, b)` | the part after the point, and the remainder **always positive**: `mod(-1, 3)` is 2, which is what something going round in a circle needs |
| `round(x)` `sign(x)` | to the nearest integer; −1, 0 or 1 |
| `noise(x)` `noise(x, y)` | smooth noise from −1 to 1: the same input, the same value, and it never jumps. `noise(time)` is a wobble that never repeats; `noise(k * 0.3, time)` a different one for each `k` |
| `random(seed)` | a number from 0 to 1 that looks random and is always the same for the same seed: in a `repeat`, `random(k)` scatters without anything moving |

**`time`** is the seconds since the scene started. It exists if the scene names it —and has not declared a `time` of its own—, and while it does, the scene never rests: that is its point. With reduced motion (`--reduced-motion`) it stops, like `spin`.

Valid as a name: a `let`, a `prop`, a `fact`, a measure (`label.width`), how much a named layout takes up and how many children it has in view (`list.width`, `list.height`, `list.count`, and with `view:` `list.content`: they can also be read before the point where it is declared, and by rules), the numeric field of a record (`r.depth`, `r.index`, `rows.count`), and the presence of a claim (`shape.rec`: 1 while it wins).

## 8. Drawing

Each element accepts these properties and no others; another one is an error, with a suggestion.

| Element | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| `ellipse` | `at` · `radius` · `scale: sx, sy` |
| `box` | `at: cx, cy` or `from: x, y` · `size: w, h` · `corner` |
| `arc` (like "∩") | `at` · `radius` · `span` (the whole angle it covers) · `width`. It opens **upwards and symmetrically**; a progress ring is `span: p * 360deg` with `rotate: p * 180deg` |
| `line` | `from` · `to` · `width` |
| `path` | `at` (what its points hang from) · `size: w, h` (what it takes up in a layout), and inside it its steps: `move x, y` (once, the first one) · `line x, y` · `curve x, y via cx, cy` · `close`. Closed, it is filled; open, or with `stroke`, it is a line |
| …and every shape | `color` · `opacity` · `rotate` · `stroke` (the outline only) · `blend` (inside a `body`: how much it melts into what came before) · `active` · `cursor` · `carries` (below) · `show` · `label` · `agent` · `role` · `value` · `checked` · `selected` (§13, *Told to an agent*) |
| `body` | `color` or `gradient` (below) · `rim` · `light: amount, from_y, height` · `shadow: dx, dy, blur, alpha[, color]` · `border: width, #color` · `glass` · `lens` · `opacity` · `show`, and inside it its shapes, melted into one silhouette |
| `text` | `at` · `anchor` · `width` · `lines` · `size` · `weight` · `color` · `opacity` · `align:` `left` `center` `right` · `line_height` · `family` · `measure` · `show` · and its effects: `gradient` · `outline` · `shadow` · `letter_move` · `letter_opacity` · `letter_scale` (§8.4) · `selectable` · `selection` |
| `image` | `at` (its **top-left corner**, not its centre: it is a rectangle of pixels, not a shape) · `size` · `opacity` · `tint` · `show` |
| `particles` | `at` · `area` · `count` · `life` · `speed` · `direction` · `spread` · `gravity` · `drag` · `size` · `colors` · `opacity` · `shape` · `emit` or `burst` · `show`: §8.3 |
| `shader` | `at` (its top left corner) · `size: w, h` · `corner` · `opacity` · `show` · `values: a, b, …` (up to eight numbers, any expression) · `colors: c1, c2` (up to two). What it is and how it is written: §8.1 |
| `figure` | `at` (where the piece's centre goes) · `size: w, h` or `scale:` (without either, one unit of the svg is one pixel) · `pivot: x, y` (in the svg's units, from its centre: the point it **turns** around, which does not move it) · `rotate` · `color` (instead of the one in the file) · `opacity` · `blend` · `stroke` · `show` |
| `input` | `at` · `width` · `size` · `weight` · `color` · `opacity` · `family` · `placeholder` · `selection` · `secret` · `show` · `label` · `agent` |
| `group` | `pivot` · `rotate` · `scale: s` or `sx, sy` · `move: dx, dy` · `opacity` (they melt as a single thing) · `size` (for whoever lays it out) · `show` · `z` (see below) · and its **effects**: `blur` · `glow` · `saturation` · `brightness` · `contrast` · `hue` · `mask` · `mode` (§8.2) |
| `popup` | `at` (inside the surface) · `size` · `open:` a fact |
| `row` `column` | `at` · `anchor` · `gap` · `padding` · `align:` `start` `center` `end` · `fill` · `corner` · `opacity` · `cursor` · `show` · `size: w, h` · `view: w, h` · `step` · `content` · `wrap: n` |
| `grid` | `at` · `columns` · `width` · `gap` · `row` (the height of every row) · `show` · `opacity`; and on its children, `span`. What it is: below |

`anchor` of a text: `left` `center` `right` and `top` `center` `bottom`, one or both (`anchor: left center`). Of a layout: `left` `center` `right` and `top` `middle` `bottom` —with no anchor, `at` is its top left corner—. `cursor:` `default` `pointer` `text` `grab` `grabbing`, and for stretching and carrying `ew_resize` `ns_resize` `nwse_resize` `nesw_resize` `move`, `not_allowed`, `crosshair`.

**A shadow can be of any colour, and everything about it is an expression.**
Black if no colour is said, which is what a shadow is on paper. On a desktop of
dark windows a black shadow has nothing to darken and reads as dirt, and a
light halo (`shadow: 0, 0, 8, 22%, #9ed6bd`, no offset, hugging the outline)
paints outside the silhouette, where it shows. Often what a small shape needs
there is its own `rim`, which is light **inside** the silhouette and touches
nothing behind it. And since the offset, the blur and the alpha are expressions
too, a shadow can show up only when there is something to cast one: `shadow: 0,
2 * open, 12 * open, 32% * open` gives a card the shadow of a card and leaves
the thing it grew out of with none. With the count at zero there is no shadow
to work out, and the renderer does not look at it.

**`glass` turns a body into glass**, from `0%` to `100%`, and like everything
else it is an expression, so it can come and go. Three things happen. The fill
becomes a tint: its `color` is still there, but what is behind shows through.
Below `100%` it is partly glass and partly its fill —at `50%`, a glass tinted
half with its colour—, with a lens or without one, and it covers as much as its
`opacity` says: going from `0` to `100%` the plain fill turns into glass with no jump.
The edge catches the light: a thin highlight on the side facing the top left,
a softer one on the opposite side, and the glass getting lighter towards its
edge, like glass seen side-on; all of it comes from where the edge points,
which a signed distance knows. And the body's `shadow` stops showing through
it: only around it. And **it bends what is behind it, like a lens**:
near the edge the background is pulled in, following a bevel with the profile
of a squircle and Snell's law (index 1.5), a touch differently for red, green
and blue; further in it is frosted. A bigger piece of glass bends more, as
thicker glass would. Pressing it lights it from the pointer, and over something
bright it tints itself a little more so what is written on it still reads. To
bend the background pleamar needs its pixels, and on Wayland only the
compositor has them: it asks for a screenshot of what is under the surface
(`wlr-screencopy`) —with the surface on top, the only thing it can give— and
works the background out, because it knows exactly what it painted itself:
screenshot = ours + (1 − our alpha) · background. It takes one after presenting,
at most every 50 ms while something moves, and when nothing moves it waits for
something behind to change: still, it costs nothing. `lens: false` keeps the glass
and leaves the bending out: the compositor blurs what is behind it instead,
which costs less; like `glass`, it is an expression, so a setting can switch
it while the scene runs. It works on layers, normal
windows and popups; where each one is on its monitor is asked of Hyprland,
and worked out from the anchor elsewhere. In pleamar-wm's own session the scene
is the whole screen and there is nothing behind it to ask for: right before a
glass is painted, what the scene has painted so far under it (the wallpaper,
the windows) is taken as its background, frosted and bent the same way. Where it cannot be done (another
system, a compositor without screencopy),
**the compositor is asked to blur what is
behind the silhouette** instead, following its shape in 2 px strips —a round thing
gets round blur, not a square—, through the standard `ext-background-effect`
protocol (Hyprland and KWin have it). Nobody has to write a blur rule for the
compositor: the scene asks. Where the compositor cannot do it, the glass is
still a tint with its light, just with nothing blurred behind. How strong the
blur is belongs to the compositor's settings. A loose shape takes `glass` too
(`box { …; color: #4a5057; glass: 100% }`), and so does the `fill` of a `row`
or a `column`: that is how a glass card holds glass plates —a mid grey at 36 %
over dark glass lightens it just enough, and each plate gets its own lit edge.
Inside a `body`, the body says it, not its shapes. Below 30 % of glass (times
opacity) no blur is asked for. The `fill` of a layout takes an opacity after the colour (`fill: ink 9%`):
inside a glass card, the plates are veils like that, not more glass —glass on
glass is what Apple says not to do—.

```
body {
    color: #1b2127
    glass: 100%
    shadow: 0, 10, 28, 30%
    box { at: 250, 160; size: 420, 220; corner: 36 }
    ellipse { at: 520, 90; radius: 46; blend: 26 }
}
```

**And how it is made is yours.** Five things go next to `glass` —on a body, a
loose shape or the `fill` of a layout—, all of them expressions, so they can
follow a fact, a spring or the pointer:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `shine: x, y` | where the light comes from: a point in the scene. The edge that faces it lights up, and moving the shape or the point moves the highlight round the rim. `shine: pointer` is the light in your hand. Without it, from the top left |
| `refraction: 100%` | how thick the glass is: how much its edge bends what is behind. `0` is flat glass, `200%` a thick lens |
| `dispersion: 100%` | how far red, green and blue come apart where it bends: the rainbow on the edge. `0` is none |
| `dome: 0%` | the middle as a magnifying glass: what is behind looks bigger towards the centre (negative, smaller) |
| `ripple: 100%` | pressing the glass sends a ring of light through it that spreads and fades, flexing it as it goes by. `0` is none; with reduced motion there is none either |

A single `box` also bends without a crease: the bevel turns its corners the
way a polished edge does, and its highlight stays an even stroke there
instead of pinching into a dot. Without `glass`, any of the five is an error:
there is nothing for it to do.

```plm
scene Lens {
    surface { size: 420, 240 }
    prop held = 0 ~calm
    body {
        color: #1b2127
        glass: 100%
        shine: pointer
        refraction: 150%
        dispersion: 250%
        dome: 40% * held
        box { at: 210, 120; size: 320, 180; corner: 28 }
    }
}
```

**A figure is an svg read as geometry, not as a stamp.** An image is rasterised
into an atlas: it shows, but it is a sticker —it melts into nothing, it cannot
be tinted by parts nor animated by layers, and scaling it is pixels—. `figure
hat = file "hat.svg"` reads the same file as **paths**, so each layer is a shape
like any other: inside a `body` it is one silhouette with it, it takes rim,
light and shadow, and it turns around its own pivot.

`figure hat { … }` draws the whole piece and `figure hat.brim { … }` one of its
layers, **in its place inside the piece**: two layers drawn separately still fit
together, which is what lets one of them turn while the others stay. What comes
across is filled and stroked paths with their colour; gradients, masks, filters
and text do not, and it says so when it reads the file instead of pretending.

A **path** is a broken or curved line. `close` closes it, and then it is filled —concave too, and crossing itself too—; unclosed, or with `stroke`, it is a line of that width with round caps. `curve` is a quadratic Bézier, and it is split into as many segments as the detour is long. Inside it is the same signed distance as the other shapes: it melts with `blend`, and it has shadow, rim, light and border like any other.

```
path {
    at: 26, 40;  stroke: 2.5;  color: mint
    move 0, 56;  line 26, 36 + breath * 5;  line 52, 44;  line 78, 12
}
```

A path carries **a single stroke** (one `move`, the first) and up to 64 already flattened points; for several, several `path`. In a layout it has to be told what it takes up with `size:`, because its box is not known until it is evaluated.

**Lists longer than what is unfolded.** A model unfolds its `max` records on load, and that is the ceiling (256). For a list of thousands, the scene declares only the **window** —what is seen and a little more— and says how long the whole list is:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `content: total * 34` | in a layout with `view:`, the real length: the scrolling runs over it, not over what is unfolded |
| `for r in rows from first` | copy 0 is record `first` of the real list, so `r.index` is the number that belongs to it |
| `move: 0, first * 34` | puts the copies in their place within the whole list |
| `list.scroll` | besides being read, it **is written** like any property: `on press top { list.scroll: 0 ~calm }` |
| `on change floor(list.scroll / 34) { emit slid(list.scroll) }` | that is how the logic learns it has to be sent another slice, wherever the movement comes from |

A layout with `view:` **is dragged** without declaring anything: on being pressed it notes where it was and follows the mouse, with its spring. And it is grabbed **from inside**: dragging is not the business of the topmost zone, but of any zone that was underneath at the press, like the wheel. That is how a list is moved by grabbing it by one of its rows.

**`size: w, h`** says how big the layout is, instead of it being however much its children came to. Its background and its zone are that size even if the children do not reach it, and —this is what it is for— it is what **`grow:`** shares out. Across the axis it is also the box that `align:` aligns in, so `align: center` in a card with `size: 173, 66` centres its contents in those 66 and not around the tallest child.

**`grow: 1`** on a child asks for the room that is left along the layout's axis, divided among those who ask in proportion to what they asked (`grow: 2` takes twice as much). What is left is the layout's size minus its padding, its gaps and whatever the children that do not grow take. Without `size:` on the layout it is an error: there is no *left over* if nobody said of how much.

A child that grows gets **the slot**; what it then draws is still its own business, so a `box` inside a `group` does not stretch. What does follow is **a text**: a growing text, or the texts inside a growing `group` or `column` that did not say their own `width`, take it from there. That is the case that bites — a name running under the switch beside it instead of ending in an ellipsis:

```
row card { size: 164, 66; gap: 10; padding: 12; fill: #1b1b1c; corner: 14
    group { size: 22, 22;  …the icon… }
    column { grow: 1; gap: 2
        text title { size: 13; color: ink }
        text subtitle { size: 11.5; lines: 1; color: #8b8f95 }   // it ends in "…" on its own
    }
    group { size: 40, 23;  …the switch… }
}
```

**`wrap: 5`** turns a layout into a **grid**: five per line and on to the next. The cell is as big as the largest child, and **what is not seen leaves no gap**, so the rest move up, with the layout's spring if it has one. It is what a `Flow` is in Quickshell.

**`grid` is a grid of cells you design with.** It shares its `width` among its
`columns`, with `gap` between them, and places its children left to right
and then down. A child takes one cell, or several with **`span:`** —a number,
which inside a `repeat` may depend on it—. It does not have to say its size:
inside it **`cell.w` and `cell.h`** are the size of its cell, so it is drawn
in its own coordinates, from its corner. With `row:` every row is that tall;
without it, each child says its height (`group { size: cell.w, 90 }`) and a
row is as tall as its tallest child. Its zones go where it goes. With a
`for` inside, a cell the list does not reach is not there —neither seen nor
pressed—, and **its place stays**: the cells never move to fill it, so six
cards that become two leave four empty places, not a reshuffled grid.

And **inside any layout —`row`, `column`, `grid`— a `prop`, a `let`, a
`fact` or a rule is not a child**: it is read where it is written, with the
names of the `repeat` around it. That is what lets each tile carry its own
spring and its own `on press` beside its drawing.

```plm
scene Tiles {
    surface { size: 480, 300 }
    fact chosen = -1
    grid {
        at: 12, 12; columns: 2; gap: 12; width: 456; row: 80
        repeat t in 0..5 {
            group {
                span: if(t == 4, 2, 1)
                on press tile.$t { chosen = t }
                box { at: cell.w / 2, cell.h / 2; size: cell.w, cell.h; corner: 14
                      color: mix(#25282b, #2f3a37, tile.$t.hover) }
                box { at: cell.w / 2, cell.h / 2; size: cell.w, cell.h; corner: 14; stroke: 1.2; color: #9ed6bd
                      opacity: if(chosen == t, 0.9, 0) }
                text pick(t, "Home", "Look", "Language", "Lock", "Wardrobe") { at: 16, 30; anchor: left center; size: 13; color: #f5f7f5 }
                zone box tile.$t { at: cell.w / 2, cell.h / 2; size: cell.w, cell.h; corner: 14; cursor: pointer }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`examples/long-list` is five thousand rows in sixteen copies: 0.49 ms per frame, and the same sixteen groups and nineteen zones however many there are.

`clip [inset n] shape` clips everything that comes after, to the end of its `group` —or, loose in the scene, up to the next named `surface`—. Up to four nested ones clip by their shape; the outer ones, by their box.

**Gradients.** In a `body`, `gradient:` takes where it goes from and to and then its colors, separated by commas. Each color can say **where it falls** (`sand 40%`); the ones that do not say it are spread evenly. From two to eight.

```
gradient: 0, 0, 0, 44, mint, coal                        // from one point to another
gradient: 0, 0 to 0, 44, mint, sand 30%, #e86a9a, coal   // the same, with stops
gradient: radial 100, 160 radius 60, ink, mint 40%, coal // from a center outwards
```

**A named shape is a zone** if some rule names it, if it carries `active`, or if it was declared with `zone`. A name put there only to read better does not stop a click. A zone inherits the transforms of the groups it is in, and **what is not there —a false `show:`, an `opacity:` that has reached zero, a record that does not exist— is not a zone**: what cannot be seen cannot be pressed. A `row` or `column` with a name is one too: its whole box, underneath those of its children.

**A zone declared with `zone` brings its own two springs**: `hit.hover` goes
from 0 to 1 while the pointer is over it, and `hit.pressed` while it is
pressed on it, each in 140 ms. They are read like any property, without a
rule: `color: mix(ink, mint, hit.hover)`. Only the zones whose `.hover` or
`.pressed` is named get them, and they can be used above the zone —which is
where what it lights goes, since the press belongs to the zone declared last—.
Inside a component or a `repeat` each copy has its own: `touch.hover`,
`hit.$k.hover`.

```plm
scene Chips {
    surface { size: 300, 80 }
    repeat k in 0..3 {
        box { at: 60 + k * 90, 40; size: 80, 34; corner: 17
              color: mix(#2a2d30, #9ed6bd, chip.$k.hover); opacity: 1 - 0.25 * chip.$k.pressed }
        zone box chip.$k { at: 60 + k * 90, 40; size: 80, 34; corner: 17; cursor: pointer }
    }
}
```

### 8.1. The scene's own shaders

What the language did not foresee can still be drawn: a scene can bring its own
shaders, in WGSL —the language wgpu speaks, on Linux, Windows and macOS alike—.
Whoever writes one writes **one function**: a colour for each point of its box.
Everything else is pleamar's: where the box goes, its rounded corners, its
opacity, the clips it is under, and painting it only when something changed.

```
shader aurora = file "shaders/aurora.wgsl"
…
shader aurora { at: 30, 30; size: 300, 200; corner: 20; values: glow, open; colors: mint, #7a6cff }
```

```wgsl
fn shade(s: Shader) -> vec4<f32> {
    let band = exp(-pow((s.uv.y - 0.4 - 0.1 * sin(s.uv.x * 6.0 + s.time)) * 6.0, 2.0));
    return vec4<f32>(mix(s.color.rgb, s.color2.rgb, s.uv.x), band * s.a.x);
}
```

It returns **the colour and how much of it covers** (straight, not premultiplied).
What it receives, in `s`:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `s.pos` · `s.size` · `s.uv` | the point inside its box, in logical pixels from the top left corner; the size of the box; and the two divided (0 to 1) |
| `s.time` | seconds since the scene started. **Only if it reads it** does the scene keep painting it: a shader that does not read `time` costs nothing while nothing changes |
| `s.pointer` · `s.hovered` | where the mouse is, in the same coordinates as `s.pos`, and 1 while it is over the box. Only if it reads them is it painted again when the mouse moves |
| `s.a` · `s.b` | the eight `values:`, four and four (`s.a.x` is the first) |
| `s.color` · `s.color2` | the two `colors:` |
| `s.scale` | real pixels per logical pixel: for lines one real pixel wide |
| `behind(s, at)` · `behind_frosted(s, at)` | **what is behind the surface** at a point (in `s.pos` coordinates), sharp or frosted: the colour, and in its alpha how much of it is known. Calling it is what asks the surface to capture it, like a `lens:` glass |
| `inside(s, at)` | only for a **group's shader** (§8.2, `shader:`): what the group holds at that point, straight colour and alpha. Anywhere else it is transparent |

Three rules, checked when the scene is read, with the file and the line of the
mistake: it has `fn shade(s: Shader) -> vec4<f32>` exactly; it declares no
bindings, no entry points and no variables outside its functions —all it can
read is `s` and `behind`—; and it is valid WGSL. Its names are its own: two
shaders can each have their own `fn wave`. A loop that never ends is still the
author's business; the card's driver will cut it, the scene with it.

What `behind` sees is what is behind the whole surface, so under the box there
must be nothing of ours that covers it: where something of the scene is solid,
it comes back unknown. And the box itself should not cover it all either —an
alpha of 0.88, like the lens— or the next frame does not know what is behind
it. It is read with the same capture as the glass, so the same thing applies:
on a compositor that does not let the screen be captured, it is always unknown.

**`z:` — what goes on top.** Groups with `z:` that are side by side (in the
same group, or loose in the scene, even from different iterations of a
`repeat`) are drawn from the smallest `z` to the biggest, whatever the order
they were written in; with the same `z`, as written. Their zones follow them:
where two overlap, the press goes to the one drawn on top. It is how windows
stack —the one you touch comes forward: `z: stamp.$i` with a fact the press
bumps— and it moves nothing else: what has no `z:` stays where it was
written. A group with `z:` inside another one with `z:` is an error: only one
level is sorted.

### 8.2. Effects on a group

A `group` can do something to everything it holds, as ONE thing, when it is
blended: what is inside is painted apart and the effect is applied to the whole.

```plm
language 0.1
scene Effects {
    surface { size: 400, 160; anchor: top }
    let mint = #5ef2b0
    group {
        glow: 14, 90%, mint                      // a halo of that colour around it
        text "online" { at: 80, 40; anchor: center; size: 16; weight: 700; color: mint }
    }
    group {
        blur: 6                                  // out of focus
        saturation: 0                            // and grey
        ellipse { at: 200, 40; radius: 20; color: #ff4d6d }
    }
    group {
        mask: 300, 20 to 300, 140                // whole at the top, gone at the bottom
        box { at: 330, 80; size: 80, 120; corner: 12; color: #7a6cff }
    }
}
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `blur: r` | out of focus, over `r` pixels |
| `glow: r, amount` · `glow: r, amount, color` | a light spilling from its edges, under what it holds: with a colour, a halo of that colour; without one, a *bloom* of its own colours. `amount` can go over 100 % |
| `saturation: s` | 0 is grey, 1 as it is, more than 1 more vivid |
| `brightness: b` · `contrast: k` | 1 is as it is |
| `hue: angle` | turns every colour round the colour wheel: `hue: 120deg` makes red green |
| `mask: x1, y1 to x2, y2` | whole at the first point, gone at the second, along that line |
| `mask: radial x, y radius r` · `… radius r1 to r2` | whole at the centre (or up to `r1`), gone at `r` (or `r2`) |
| `shader: rain, a, b, …` | one of the scene's own shaders (§8.1) **over what the group holds**: it reads it with `inside(s, at)` and what it returns is seen instead. Its box is the group's, the numbers after the name are `s.a` and `s.b`, and `s.time` runs if it reads it. That is how a window becomes wet glass: drops that bend what the program shows. It goes before the other effects (a `saturation:` greys what the shader returns); `blur` and `glow` read the group as it was. It cannot call `behind` |
| `mode: add` · `mode: screen` · `mode: multiply` | how it blends with what is under it, as one thing. `add` **adds light**: what it holds brightens whatever is under it, also the desktop behind the surface. `screen` lightens —never past white, never darker—; over nothing it is simply itself. `multiply` darkens what **the scene** painted under it, tinting it; the desktop behind the surface is not in pleamar's hands, so over nothing it paints nothing (rather than black). `mode: normal` is the default |

All of them are expressions, so they animate like anything else: `blur: 8 * (1
- open)` brings something into focus as it opens. The mask moves with the group
(`move:`, `rotate:`). Each group with effects is painted into a layer right
before it is blended, one after another, so there can be as many as the scene
wants; what they cost is the pixels they cover, and `blur` and `glow` read 32
points per pixel.

Two groups with effects cannot go **one inside the other** —only the outer one
would get them, and so it is an error—; side by side, as many as needed. A group
with only `opacity` around one with effects is fine: it fades each thing inside
instead of the whole, and the effects keep their layer.

### 8.3. Particles

An emitter: sparks, snow, confetti, a trail. **No particle is kept anywhere**:
each one is worked out on the graphics card from its number and the time —when
it was born, where it went, how it fell—, so thousands cost what their pixels
cost and nothing in the processor.

```plm
language 0.1
scene Fountain {
    surface { size: 300, 260; anchor: top }
    fact open = true
    event pop
    group {
        glow: 8, 90%                                       // they are light: a glow suits them
        particles sparks {
            at: 150, 240; count: 400
            life: 0.8s .. 1.6s; speed: 120 .. 220
            direction: -90deg; spread: 40deg; gravity: 0, 260
            size: 3, 1; colors: #ffd166, #ff4d6d; opacity: 100%, 0%
            shape: spark; emit: open
        }
    }
    particles { at: 150, 120; count: 200; life: 1s .. 2s; speed: 150 .. 380; spread: 140deg
                gravity: 0, 420; drag: 1.4; size: 6, 5; colors: #5ef2b0, #3dd6ff; shape: square; burst: pop }
}
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `at: x, y` · `area: w, h` | where they are born: a point, or anywhere in a box that size centred on it. If `at` moves —`at: pointer.x, pointer.y`— what was born stays where it was born: it leaves a trail |
| `count: n` | how many at most, 1 to 4096. A number, not an expression: it is what the card reserves |
| `life: a .. b` | how long each one lives, in seconds, each its own between the two. A steady stream is born at `count / b` per second |
| `speed: a .. b` · `direction: angle` · `spread: angle` | how fast they leave, where to (`-90deg` is up) and how open the fan is (`360deg`, all round, is the default) |
| `gravity: x, y` · `drag: k` | what pulls them, in pixels per second squared, and how much the air brakes them (0: nothing) |
| `size: birth, death` · `colors: birth, death` · `opacity: birth, death` | from one to the other over their life; one value, the same all their life. By default they fade out |
| `shape: dot \| square \| spark` | a disc, a square, or a streak along where it goes that stretches with its speed |
| `emit: condition` | born while it holds —`true` by default—. Switched off, no more are born and the ones in the air finish |
| `burst: event` | instead, all at once each time that event happens |

They carry themselves, so the scene does not rest while one is in the air —and
rests again when the last one dies—. With reduced motion there are none. An
emitter with `shape: spark` inside a group with `glow:` is most of what a
firework is.

### 8.4. Text with effects

A `text` can have a gradient across its letters, an outline and a shadow, and
each letter can move, fade and grow on its own.

```plm
language 0.1
scene Title {
    surface { size: 420, 160; anchor: top }
    prop reveal = 0 ~2s
    follow reveal = 1
    text "PLEAMAR" { at: 210, 50; anchor: center; size: 48; weight: 800; color: #fff
                     gradient: 100, 0 to 320, 0, #5ef2b0, #7a6cff, #ff6f91
                     outline: 2, #0b0f14; shadow: 3, 5, 6, 70%, #000000 }
    text "one letter at a time" { at: 210, 110; anchor: center; size: 18; color: #f5f7f5
                                  letter_opacity: clamp(reveal * letters - letter, 0, 1) }
}
```

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `gradient:` | like a `body`'s (§8): `x1, y1 to x2, y2, colours…` or `radial x, y radius r, colours…`, in the scene's coordinates. It replaces `color` for the fill |
| `outline: width, color` | the letters grown by `width`, in that colour, under them |
| `shadow: dx, dy, blur, alpha` · `…, color` | the letters moved and blurred, under everything; black unless a colour is given |
| `letter_move: dx, dy` · `letter_opacity: o` · `letter_scale: s` | each letter on its own. Inside them, **`letter`** is which one (from 0) and **`letters`** how many there are: `letter_move: 0, sin(time * 300 + letter * 35) * 5` is a wave, `letter_opacity: clamp(reveal * letters - letter, 0, 1)` a typewriter as `reveal` goes from 0 to 1, `letter_scale: 1 + 0.3 * max(0, sin(time * 240 - letter * 25))` a ripple of growth |

A letter scaled up covers its neighbours: scale is around its own centre, the
line does not open up for it. Colour letters (emoji) take the movement, fading
and scale, not the outline, shadow or gradient.

**Text that can be copied.** `selectable: true` lets the mouse select a text,
as in a browser: dragging over its letters (across lines too), a double click
for a word, a third for the whole text; **Ctrl+C** copies it, unless the field
being typed into has a selection of its own. What is selected is painted behind
the letters in `selection:` (a muted blue if not said). A press on its letters
belongs to the selection, not to the zones under it —dragging over the text of
a `view:` list selects instead of scrolling it; the wheel still scrolls—, but a
zone with `cursor: pointer`, a field or something that `carries:` keeps its
click. Over the letters the cursor is the text one. Pressing anywhere else lets
go of the selection.

```
text r.text { at: 2, 2; width: 520; size: 13.5; color: ink; selectable: true; selection: #2f5a50 }
```

## 9. Layouts

`row` and `column` place their children one after another: the place of each one is an expression, so if one grows or disappears, the rest move. With `~spring` in the header, they travel to their place instead of jumping. Every child has to know how much it takes up: a shape with `size` or `radius`, a text (it measures itself), an image, a `group` or a component with `size:`, another layout, or `space n`. `show: expr` on a child decides whether it is there: it takes up room and is seen, or neither of the two.

**Lists longer than the room they have.** `view: w, h` says what is seen; what is inside can be longer and **moves with the wheel**, clipped and never past what there is. `step:` is how much per notch (60 by default), and the layout's spring is the one it travels with. Besides `width`, `height` and `count`, it publishes `list.content` —how much there is— and `list.scroll` —where it is— which is what is needed to paint a little bar alongside:

```
column list { at: 16, 16;  view: 250, 208;  gap: 6
    for r in rows { Row(r) }
}
box { from: 276, 16 + list.scroll / max(list.content, 1) * 208
      size: 4, 208 * 208 / max(list.content, 208);  corner: 2;  color: ink;  opacity: 35% }
```

With `view:`, outwards it takes up what is seen, not what it carries inside.

`between { box { size: 272, 1; color: ink } }` puts that **between every two children that are there**: if one disappears, so does its line, and there is never one at the start or at the end. **It does not open another gap**: it goes centred in the `gap` that is already between its neighbours, so the distance between two children is the `gap` plus what it takes up. With a single thing inside, that thing says how much it takes up; with several, the `between` acts as a group and says it itself (`between { size: 10, 12; … }`). `between i { … }` gives it its position —1 after the first child, 2 after the second…—, so the first one can be different: `opacity: if(i == 1, 50%, 12%)`. A named layout publishes, besides `list.width` and `list.height`, **`list.count`**: how many children are there right now. All three can also be read before the point where it is declared.

## 10. Components, `repeat`, `for`

`component Name(parameters) { size: w, h; … }` declares; `Name(arguments)` places a copy. `size:` says how much it takes up, for whoever lays it out. What a copy declares —`prop`, named shapes, rules— is its own.

**A component says what it needs.** Each parameter can carry a type and a default value: `component Row(r: record, chosen: event, tone: color = mint, height: number = 30)`.

| Type | What is passed to it | Inside |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `number` | an expression | valid in any expression |
| `color` | `#fff`, a color `let`, `mix(…)` | wherever a color goes |
| `text` | `"in quotes"` (with slots, if it likes) or the name of a live text | `text name { … }`, and in a slot: `"{name}"` |
| `record` | a record: that of a `for`, or `rows.0` | `r.field`, `r.index` |
| `event` | the name of an event of the scene | `emit name(…)` and `on name { … }` talk about **that** event |
| `image` | the name of an image | `image name { … }` |
| `bool` | an expression (`true`, `false`, `count > 3`) | valid in any expression |
| `gesture` | the name of a gesture | `play name` |
| `spring` | the name of a spring, or `spring(170, 12)` | `~name` |

That way a library component does not take it for granted that the scene has an event called in a certain way: it asks for it. Arguments go **by position and then, if wanted, by name** (`Row(r, choose, height: 40)`); from the first one with a name, all with a name. The ones that have a default value can be omitted, and they go at the end. Whatever is missing, extra, repeated or not of the type is an error where it is used, showing the whole signature: `'Row' is missing 'chosen' (an event): it is Row(r: record, chosen: event, tone: color = …)`. The default value is read where the component is used, so `= mint` is the `mint` of that scene.

With no type (`component Dot(tone)`), the parameter is whatever the argument looks like: it is how they used to be written, and it is still valid.

**A slot for children: `children`.** What a copy brings inside its block —besides properties like `show:`— goes wherever its component says `children`:

```
component Card(title: text) {
    size: 300, 40 + inside.height            // as big as whatever is put into it
    body { color: #1b1c1c; box { from: 0, 0; size: 300, 40 + inside.height; corner: 12 } }
    text "{upper(title)}" { at: 12, 18; anchor: left center; size: 11; color: ink }
    column inside { at: 12, 32; gap: 4;  children }
}

Card("Alerts") {
    text title { size: 14; color: ink }      // the scene's `title`, not Card's parameter
    repeat i in 0..2 { text "row {i}" { size: 13; color: ink } }
}
```

Inside a `row` or a `column`, each child takes its place in the layout (and a `repeat` or a `for` from outside unfolds like the ones inside); loose, `children { move: x, y }` is a group. **Children are read with the names of whoever wrote them**: a component neither sees nor treads on what is put into it, and a parameter of its own covers nothing from outside. **Several slots, with names.** A component has at most one `children` with no name and as many with one as it likes: `children header`, `children footer`. In the copy, a block with that name is what goes into that slot —**even if the scene has a component called the same: inside the copy, the slot wins**—, and the rest goes to the one that has no name. A slot cannot be called like a word of the language.

```
Panel {
    header { text "Alerts" { … } }
    for n in notes { text n.title { … } }        // to the `children` with no name
    footer { box ok { … };  box no { … } }
}
```

A slot that does not exist is an error that says which ones there are (`'Panel' has no slot called 'heder': it has header, footer. Did you mean 'header'?`), and so is putting something into a component with no `children`: not a silence.

An error **inside** a component also says where it was used from —`(inside 'Badge', used at scene.plm:6)`—, because often what is wrong is what was passed to it.

`repeat i in 0..5 { … }` unfolds five turns on load (512 at most); inside, `i` is a number and `$i` is substituted into the names.

`for r in rows { … }` unfolds one turn per record that fits in the model. Inside, `r.field` is the field of that record —a text wherever a live text goes, a number in any expression— and `r.index` its position from 0. **Each turn only exists if the list reaches that far.** Valid inside a layout, loose, and inside a `popup`.

### 10.1. Pages: `pages`

A panel with several pages shows one at a time: `pages` says so.

```
pages settings {
    header: 20, 45                       // where the title goes; optional
    page menu "Settings" { … }           // the first is where it starts
    page look "Her look" { … }
    page language "Language" { … }
}
```

**`settings` is a fact** with the pages' names —`menu | look | language`—,
declared from the start wherever the `pages` is written, so anything reads it
and sets it: `on press tile { settings = look }`, or the logic
(`fact.settings = "look"`). Each page **slides in** as it becomes the one —the
first from the left, the others from the right— and fades out as it goes, and
what is not seen is not pressed: its zones are only there while it is. With
**`header: x, y`**, at that point comes the page's title —the one written after
its name, translated like any other text— and, on any page but the first, a
**←** beside it that goes back to the first; **Esc** goes back too.

### 10.2. The pieces that come with pleamar: `pleamar:ui`

`import "pleamar:ui"` brings pleamar's own library, which comes inside the
program: it is there wherever the scene is and whoever runs it. Each piece
answers the mouse by itself —it lights up under the pointer and gives a little
when pressed— and says what happened through the event it is given: what that
does is the scene's business. They are drawn from their own corner, so they go
in a `row`, a `column` or a cell of a `grid`.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `Switch(on, press)` | a switch: `on` is whether it is on (an expression), `press` the event it fires. `on flip { toggle following }` |
| `Radio(on, press)` | a round choice: the ring, and the dot when `on` |
| `Segmented(value, a, b, press, c: "…", count: 3, width: 240)` | two or three choices in a pill, with the chosen one's background sliding to it; `press` carries which one: `on pick_mode(v) { mode = v }` |
| `Tile(title, value, press, w, h: 106)` | a plate that answers the mouse, with its name, its value and a ›; what goes in its round badge is whatever is put inside it |
| `Card(w, h, padding: 16)` | a plate, and in a column inside it whatever is put inside it |

All of them take `accent:` (the colour of what is on), except `Card`.

```plm
import "pleamar:ui"
scene Pieces {
    surface { size: 480, 300 }
    fact following = false
    fact mode = 1
    event flip
    event pick_mode
    event opened
    on flip { toggle following }
    on pick_mode(v) { mode = v }
    grid {
        at: 12, 12; columns: 2; gap: 12; width: 456; row: 106
        Tile("Where she lives", pick(following, "Home", "Follows you"), opened, cell.w) {
            box { size: 22, 14; corner: 3; stroke: 1.6; color: #f5f7f5 }
        }
        Tile("Language", pick(mode, "System", "English", "Español"), opened, cell.w) {
            text "Aa" { size: 16; weight: 700; color: #f5f7f5 }
        }
    }
    Card(456, 120) {
        move: 12, 130
        row { gap: 12; align: center
            Switch(following, flip)
            text "Follow me" { size: 13; color: #f5f7f5 }
        }
        Segmented(mode, "System", "English", pick_mode, c: "Español", count: 3, width: 240)
    }
}
```

### 10.3. Other programs' windows: `windows`

`windows win max 6` puts a Wayland compositor inside the scene —with
[pleamar-wm](https://github.com/k4ditano/pleamar-wm), which is pleamar with
one inside; plain `pleamar` reads these scenes but holds no windows—. Programs
started with `launch "kitty"` —or by hand, with the `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` that
`win.socket` says— open in it, and each one takes a slot, `win.0` to `win.5`.
Where it goes, how big, how it arrives and how it leaves is the scene's: the
window manager is the `.plm` file, with its springs, rules and zones, and it
reloads on save while the programs in it keep running.

| per slot | |
| --- | --- |
| `win.$i.open` · `win.$i.focused` | whether there is a window in it, and whether it has the keyboard |
| `win.$i.title` · `win.$i.app` | texts: what the window calls itself, and its program (`kitty`) |
| `win.$i.width` · `win.$i.height` | the size it has drawn itself at |
| `win.$i.place` | its turn in the layout of its monitor: 0 leads, −1 if there is none. `promote` changes it |
| `win.$i.screen` | the monitor it is on: which copy of a `screens: each` scene lays it out |
| `win.$i.minimized` | it is put away: its minimize button, the scene (`minimize`), or whoever lists the windows (a dock, Marea). It is left out of the layout's order, as a dialog is; `restore` brings it back |
| `win.$i.floating` | it floats over the layout (`float`): `.place` is −1 and `.among` and `win.on.$s` do not count it, so the others close up as if it were a dialog; it keeps its turn in `win.order`, `.rank` and `win.count` (the keyboard still reaches it). The compositor keeps it: a reload of the scene does not lose it. `tile` puts it back; it ends when the window closes |
| `win.$i.dialog` | it is a dialog: it belongs to another window, or has a size of its own it cannot leave (a message, a file chooser). It is left out of the layout's order (`place` −1, not counted in `win.on`): float it over the rest, at its own size (`ask: 0, 0`) |
| `win.$i.urgent` | it asks for attention: it asked to come forward with nothing of the user's behind it (a message arrived while another window had the keyboard). Until it gets the keyboard. A dock makes its icon hop, as macOS does |
| `win.$i.framed` | it lets the compositor draw its frame (server-side decorations, X11 programs): draw its title bar. False, it draws its own —a GTK 4 header bar, a browser's tabs—: draw none |
| `win.$i.held` · `win.$i.edges` | what it asks from its own title bar or edges while the button is down: 1 to be carried with the mouse, 2 to be stretched by `edges` (1 top, 2 bottom, 4 left, 8 right, added: 10 is the bottom right corner); 0 when the button is let go. Floating windows follow `cursor.x`, `cursor.y` while it lasts |
| `win.$i.fullscreen` | it is fullscreen: it asked (a video, a game, F11) or the scene did. Where it goes is still the scene's: draw it over the whole monitor, and ask it for that size |
| `win.$i.workspace` | the workspace it is on, by its turn in its monitor's stack (from 1): the one its monitor showed when it opened, or the one it was sent to. It changes when one above it dries up |
| `win.$i.pool` | the same workspace by its identity, which never changes: compare this one to tell whether two windows share a workspace, or whether it is the one shown (`win.pool.$s`) |
| `win.$i.among` | how many windows share its monitor **and** its workspace: what its layout is shared out among. `place` is its turn among them |
| `win.$i.rank` | its turn among all the windows shown, −1 if it is not (another workspace, put away, a dialog) |
| **for all of them** | |
| `win.count` · `win.focus` | how many are shown (on the workspaces their monitors show), and which slot has the keyboard (−1, none) |
| `win.on.$s` | how many are shown on monitor `s` (0 to 3) |
| `win.shown.$s` · `win.pool.$s` | the workspace monitor `s` shows: its turn, and its identity |
| `win.pools.$s` · `win.used.$s` | how many workspaces monitor `s` has (the one shown among them, even empty), and how many hold windows |
| `win.$i.icon` | the icon of its program, from its `.desktop` (a generic one if nothing installed says it): `image i = from win.$i.icon, 64, 64` |
| `win.docks.$s` · `win.dock.$s.$k.icon` | monitor `s`'s dock: how many items it has (the programs the compositor has pinned, then the others with windows on the workspace it shows, as they opened), and each one's icon |
| `win.dock.$s.$k.windows` · `.focused` · `.pinned` · `.away` | that item's windows there, whether one of them has the keyboard, whether it is pinned, and how many of them are put away |
| `win.$i.dockat` · `win.$i.dockturn` · `win.$i.minat` · `win.mins.$s` | its item in its monitor's dock, its turn among that item's windows, and its turn among the ones put away there (−1: none); how many are put away on monitor `s` |
| `win.dock.$s.$k.name` · `win.dock.$s.$k.badge` | the item's program's name, and how much is unread for it: whoever keeps the notifications says it in `win.badges` (`pleamar-wm --say wm "text win.badges discord:3 telegram:1"`), by any of the names the program goes by |
| `win.reserved.$s.top` · `.right` · `.bottom` · `.left` | what other programs' bars keep on monitor `s` at that edge, in pixels (layer-shell's exclusive zones): lay the windows out around it |
| `win.order.$p` | which slot is at each place among the ones shown: `win.order.0` leads |
| `win.socket` | where programs connect |
| `win.picking` | what the compositor asks the scene to choose, 0 while it asks nothing: 1 a monitor, 2 a window, 3 either (a program wants to share the screen). The scene draws its chooser and answers with `pick` |

`window win.$i { at: x, y; size: w, h }` draws that slot's window in that box.
`ask: w, h` is the size it is told to have, by default `size` (`ask: 0, 0`: the one it chooses; `ask: -1, -1`: none, a picture of it drawn somewhere else —a preview— that must not ask it for another size than the copy that lays it out): let the box
travel on its springs and `ask` be where it is going, and the program is only
asked once, not every frame. While box and `ask` differ, the window is scaled
by as much as its box is; a program that cannot be that small comes out cut at
its box, not squashed. The window is a zone with its name —`on press win.$i`,
`win.$i.hover`— and the mouse and the keys reach it through it: the pointer in
its own pixels, the keys while it has the keyboard, except the ones the scene
has a rule for (`on key Alt+Return`, or `on key Escape while overview` while
that holds), which are the scene's.

| effect | |
| --- | --- |
| `launch "kitty"` | starts a program so that it opens here |
| `focus win.$i` · `focus win(expr)` | the keyboard goes to that window |
| `close win.$i` · `close win(win.focus)` | asks it to close, as its own close button would |
| `promote win.$i` | it goes first in the layout: `place` 0 |
| `send win.$i to 1` · `send win(win.focus) to 0` | to that monitor |
| `swap win.$i with win.$j` · `swap win(a) with win(b)` | they change places: their turn in the layout, and their monitors |
| `minimize win.$i` · `restore win.$i` | put away, and back: the program and whoever lists the windows are told |
| `float win.$i` · `tile win.$i` | one window over the layout, and back into it (`win.$i.floating`); its monitor stays tiled |
| `fullscreen win.$i` · `fullscreen win(win.focus)` | to fullscreen, or back from it: the program is told (it hides its own bars) and `win.$i.fullscreen` says so |
| `workspace 3` · `workspace n on 1` | that workspace shown on the monitor the pointer is on, or on that one —no further than the empty one past the last that holds windows—. The keyboard goes to the window that last had it there; with none there, nobody has it |
| `send win(win.focus) to workspace 2` · `… to workspace 2 on 1` | that window to that workspace, on its monitor or on that one (the same limit) |
| `dock 2 on 0` · `dock k` | that item of monitor `s`'s dock (the one the pointer is on, without `on`): its window —the next one, if one of them has the keyboard; brought back, if put away— or, with none there, its program started |
| `dock k on s with drop` · `… pin` · `… unpin` · `… close` | the files just dropped on it (`on drop zone`) opened with its program; the program pinned to the dock, or unpinned (the compositor keeps it: pleamar-wm writes its `dock` line); its windows there asked to close |
| `send workspace 2 on 0 to 1` · `send workspace n to 1` | the whole workspace, with its windows, to that monitor —from the one the pointer is on, without `on`—: it goes to the end of that one's stack and is shown there; the monitor it left shows the one beside it |
| `pick win.$i` · `pick win(x)` · `pick screen 1` · `pick none` | the answer to `win.picking`: that window, that monitor, or nothing (the program's request is turned down). The compositor stops asking: `win.picking` goes back to 0 |

**Workspaces** are a stack per monitor, each monitor its own, as tide
pools along a shore: there are as many as hold windows, plus the one shown
even when it is empty; one left empty dries up when the monitor shows another,
and the ones below it move up (their `workspace` changes, their `pool` does
not). Past the last one with windows there is always one more to go to.
What is on another workspace is still laid out —`place` and `among` count per
monitor and workspace—, so a scene can draw one leaving and the next arriving
(pleamar-wm's `session.plm` draws a wave crossing the monitor, and changes
the windows it shows when the water covers them: by `pool`, so nothing moves
when the numbers do). With a copy of the scene per monitor (`screens: each`), a window opens on the
monitor the pointer is on, and each copy draws the ones whose `screen` is its
own (`show: win.$i.screen == screen.index`); a window is only asked for a size
by the copy that shows it.

A window that closes leaves its last image in its slot: the scene can see it
leave, fading on a spring, instead of vanishing. Programs that draw with the
GPU hand over their frames on the card as they are; X11 programs open through
XWayland like any other. A whole window manager is in pleamar-wm's `examples/windows.plm`.

```plm
scene Nested {
    surface { size: 900, 600; kind: window; title: "nested" }
    windows win max 2
    // Alone it takes it all; with company, half each, sliding over on a spring.
    prop w0 = 900 ~lively
    follow w0 = if(win.count > 1.5, 450, 900)
    window win.0 { at: 0, 0; size: w0, 600; ask: if(win.count > 1.5, 450, 900), 600; show: win.0.open }
    window win.1 { at: w0, 0; size: 450, 600; show: win.1.open }
    on key Alt+Return { launch "kitty" }
    on key Alt+q { close win(win.focus) }
}
```

## 11. Text with slots

Inside a text in quotes that is the content of a `text` or the argument of a component:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `{name}` | a live text, or the `text` field of a record |
| `{expr}` · `{expr, n}` | an expression, with n decimals (0 if unsaid) |
| `{expr, time}` | that many seconds, the way a clock writes them: `1:07`, and `1:02:07` past the hour |
| `{upper(name)}` · `{lower(name)}` | that text, in upper or lower case |
| `{? … }` | a stretch that is only there if none of the texts inside it is empty |
| `{{` · `}}` | a real brace |

The names of a slot are resolved where the string is written, not where it is used.

### 11.1. Translations

A scene is written in one language —`en`— and **`translations`** give it others. Each
block is a language and, inside, each text as written and what it becomes; slots
included, and they may move:

```
translations es {
    "Control center" = "Centro de control"
    "{n} notices"    = "{n} avisos"
}
```

With at least one block, the fact **`locale`** exists by itself: an enum with `en`
and each translated language, in order (`locale == es`). It starts as the system's
language —`LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, `LANG`; `es_ES.UTF-8` is `es`— or `en` if it is not
one of them, and **it can change while the scene runs**: a rule (`locale = es`) or the
logic (`fact.locale = "es"`) switch **every text at once**, without reloading anything.
That is how a Settings page offers a language.

What is translated: the text of a `text "…"`, with its slots; the value of a declared
`text name = "…"` (while the logic has not written something else into it); a
component's string argument; an `input`'s `placeholder`. What the logic writes itself
goes through **`tr("…")`**, which returns it in the language `locale` says, from the same
tables. A text with no letters (`·`, `{n} %`) is not asked for.

The tables can live anywhere in the scene, or in a library that only has them
(`import "lang/es.plm"`): they are read before anything else. A text some language
lacks is shown as written there, and loading the scene says so, once:
`translations · es: 2 texts without a translation, shown as written: «Wi-Fi», «Search»`.
The same text translated twice into a language, a translation into `en`, or a scene
fact of its own called `locale`, are errors.

## 12. Layers

`layer name [~spring] { claims }`. **The first claim that holds wins**, from top to bottom; when it stops holding, the next one is seen, on its own. A claim is a `name` followed by when —`while expr`, `for 700ms after event, other`, `from event until event`, or nothing (the default)— and, if it likes, a block with its choreography: where each property goes, with which spring and with which delay. The destination is an expression evaluated when its turn comes. `layer.claim` is 1 while it wins, and it can be read in any expression.

## 13. Rules

`on trigger { effects }` and `every 2s..7s [while expr] { effects }`.

| Trigger | When |
| --- | --- |
| `press zone` · `press right zone` · `press middle zone` | it is pressed. A scene that uses `right` for anything is never closed by a right click: the prototype's emergency exit is only for scenes that do not use it |
| `release zone` | what was pressed there is released, wherever the mouse is by then |
| `hold zone for 500ms` | it has been held down that long |
| `enter zone` · `leave zone` | the mouse enters or leaves |
| `hover zone for 320ms` · `away zone for 420ms` | it has been over it that long; it was over it and has been away that long |
| `scroll zone` | the wheel, over any zone underneath it. Read in `wheel` |
| `drag zone` | it moves with the button down; it keeps going even if it leaves, until release. `local.x`, `drag.dx`. Like the wheel, it works for any zone that was underneath at the press, not only the topmost one: that is how a list is dragged by grabbing it by a row |
| `change expr` | that computation stops being worth what it was worth. Being born does not count: it fires on changing |
| `still expr for 1.1s` | that computation has been worth the same for that long. The reverse of `change`, and like it, being born does not count. Every change puts the clock back to zero, so a run —the volume key pressed six times— is one wait and not six, and what it fires happens once when the run ends |
| `key Escape` · `key Ctrl+k` | a key; the surface has to ask for the keyboard. Modifiers: `Ctrl+` `Alt+` `Super+` `Shift+`, in any order. `Shift+` counts with another modifier or a key that writes nothing (`Super+Shift+Left`, `Shift+F5`); a character already says it: `key question`, not `Shift+question` |
| `submit field` | Enter inside that `input` |
| `focus` · `blur` | the surface gains or loses the keyboard |
| `drop zone` | something dragged from another application is dropped on it. While it is being carried over the surface, not yet let go, the fact `drag.over` is 1: a scene can open its arms before it arrives |
| `carry zone` | what that zone carries (`carries:`, below) has just been dragged out of it to another program |
| `idle for 14s` | nobody touches anything for that long. In a scene that names `cursor.x`, moving the mouse anywhere on the desktop counts as touching |
| `event_name` | that event happens: the logic emits it, or another rule, or a gesture, or it comes from outside |
| `event_name(v)` | the same, and inside the rule —in its `while` and its effects— `v` is the value it arrived with: `on chosen(v) { mode = v }`. It is how a component that says *which* (a segment, a row) is answered without logic |

**And the other way: `carries:`.** A zone with `carries: "{file.$k.path}"` can be dragged out to another program: pressed and moved more than a few pixels, the compositor takes the drag and whatever it is let go on gets that. A path or an address (`/…`, `file://…`, `https://…`, one per line for several) goes as a list of files or links —a browser uploads it, a file manager copies it— and as text too; anything else, as text. From then on the pointer is the compositor's, so the zone's own `drag` rules stop there; `on carry zone` says it has gone —a panel it came out of can close then, and let the drop reach what is underneath—. It works on any compositor with drag and drop (Hyprland, pleamar-wm); not yet from pleamar-wm's own scene.

**Told to an agent: `label:` and `agent:`.** A running scene can be asked what there is to read and touch: `pleamar --say notes describe` answers with each surface that is on screen and, inside it, every zone and field by its name, what it is (`button`, `slider`, `field`, `list`, `item` or `region`, from what its rules do), what it says, whether it is inactive or covered by another one, and its box in the surface's pixels, together with the words drawn outside every zone —a title, a status line—, in the order they were written; `describe json`, the same as data. What it says is the texts drawn inside it, or a field's text and its `placeholder`. When that is not enough —an icon with no word in it, a slider whose name is drawn beside it—, **`label:`** says it: a text, with holes if it needs them (`label: "Delete {n.title}"`), a live text, or `pick(k, "Brightness", "Volume")` in a copy. The first time it is asked, a zone that can be pressed and says nothing is named in the log, so that nobody has to guess what it is. The same names are used to **act, as a hand would**: `press save` (and `right`, `middle`, a count), `hold`, `drag knob 0 -40`, `wheel list -3`, `type query some words`, `key escape`. The hand enters the zone, presses and leaves, so its springs move and its rules fire as with a mouse; a row scrolled out of its list is brought into sight first; and the answer is what happened —the events, the facts and texts that changed, the surfaces that opened—. What a person could not do is refused, saying why: inactive, covered, not on screen. And **`wait status == "Saved"`** answers as soon as that holds (`wait dirty == true 2s`; facts, texts and properties by name, `has`, `and`, `or`, `not`), and **`watch`** writes a line for each thing that happens for ten seconds (`watch 30`). **`agent: no`** keeps a zone or a field for a person's hand: it is described, but an agent cannot use it, and a field's text is not given; a field with `secret: true` never gives it either. **`agent: hidden`** leaves it out altogether, and on a `surface` everything it holds. When what it is cannot be told from its rules, a zone says it: **`role:`** `button` `toggle` `slider` `tab` `link` `item` `list` `region`; **`value:`** what it is worth, a text (`value: "{volume * 100} %"`) or a sum (`value: volume`; a fact with names says its name); **`checked:`** whether a toggle is on; **`selected:`** whether a row or a tab is the chosen one (`selected: sel == r.index`). A `kind: lock` surface and one with `captures: hidden` are never told. What else comes, and why: [note 12](12-agents.md).

```plm
scene Told {
    surface { size: 300, 120; kind: window; title: "told" }
    fact armed = false
    image trash = icon "user-trash", 24, 24
    box delete { from: 20, 40; size: 40, 40; cursor: pointer; label: "Delete"; agent: no }
    image trash { at: 28, 48; size: 24, 24 }
    on press delete { toggle armed }
}
```

**Any rule accepts `while expr`** at the end of its header: it is looked at at the moment of firing — **at the state the frame began with**, so two rules that fire in the same frame both see the same one, and the one declared last is the one whose value stays. In `idle` and `every` it also decides whether the wait counts.

| Effect | |
| --- | --- |
| `prop: value ~spring after 70ms` | that property heads there. Without `~`, **with its own spring**: the one it was declared with |
| `fact = expr` | evaluated on firing |
| `toggle fact` | |
| `emit event` · `emit event(expr)` | with a payload, which reaches the logic and the rules that read it with `on event(v)` |
| `impulse prop -620` · `impulse pop left * 5` | a shove: it adds to the velocity of the spring. The amount is evaluated on firing, so it can depend on what is going on: a countdown's bounce shrinks with the number left |
| `play gesture` | it asks for it; it will be granted or not, depending on its class |
| `focus field` · `blur` | gives the writing cursor to an `input`, or takes it away |

## 14. Movement that carries itself

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `blink eyelid every 2.4s..6s for 170ms` · `blink lid every 5.2s for 120ms` | from 1 to 0 and back, every now and then. Without `..`, always the same wait. The period runs **start to start**: "every 5.2 s" is every 5.2 s, not 5.2 s after the eye closed |
| `wave breath = amplitude at 1.7` | amplitude · sin(1.7 t) |
| `spin angle by 0.9` | += 0.9 per second |
| `follow chip.w = label.width + 32` | chases the expression, with its spring |
| `look gx, gy at cx, cy reach 5, 3.2 within 140 rest rx, ry` | two properties that pull towards the mouse |

With reduced motion (`--reduced-motion`) the first three go quiet: `blink`
stays open, `wave` rests at the middle of its travel and `spin` stops where it
was. What carries itself is exactly what must not be left going round on its
own. `follow` and `look` are not loops —they chase something— so they stay,
with their springs settling at once like every other one.

## 15. Gestures

A gesture is a timeline over the properties of the pose (`pose`). `gesture name class { frames }`; classes, from weakest to strongest: `ambient` < postures < `reflex` < `asked` < `state`. **A gesture only cuts off another of its own class or lower.** A frame is a duration, and if it likes a curve —one of the named ones, or `bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2)` with the same two control points as CSS's `cubic-bezier`, so a curve from any design tool is copied as is; the x of both go from 0 to 1, the y can overshoot—, `hold 60ms` (holds there) and `emit event` —which fires when the frame **begins**: to say "done", give it a short frame of its own at the end—; its block says where each property goes, and whatever it does not name returns to its base. With no block, it is the return to the base. `posture name while expr { … }` repeats on its own while that is true.

**A spring can be said in time.** `~620ms` is the spring that arrives in 620 ms
and does not bounce: critically damped, worked out from the time asked for.
Animation contracts are written in milliseconds, and this is how they get
transcribed without stopping being springs — they keep their speed, they can be
interrupted halfway, and they survive a hot reload. Measured: `~620ms` reaches
99 % at 617 ms.

`~0ms` is not a spring: the value is there at once and still, with no speed
to carry, and whatever moves it next does so with its own spring. It is how a
thing is put where it already is before it glides away —a window let go
where the mouse left it: `dx: here - there ~0ms`, then `dx: 0 after 30ms`—.
Jumping there with a fast spring instead gives it that speed, and it overshoots.

**A gesture outranks whatever is ambient.** While it is holding a pose, any
`blink`, `wave` or `spin` on that same pose goes quiet, **and its clock stops with
it**: after the gesture, it picks up where it left off instead of firing at once
everything it owed. That is what lets a breath carry its own blink without the
regular one landing on top of it.

## 16. Checked examples

These compile with `./run-tests.sh`.

A list that comes from data, with a component, text with slots, and one rule per row:

```plm
language 0.1
scene Reference1 {
    surface { size: 320, 220; anchor: top; margin: 40 }
    let ink = #f5f7f5
    model notes max 4 { app: text; title: text; body: text; urgency: number = 1 }
    event opened ->

    text "{notes.total} alerts" { at: 20, 20; anchor: left center; size: 15; weight: 600; color: ink }
    column list ~calm { at: 20, 40; gap: 6
        for n in notes { Note(n) }
    }
    component Note(n) {
        size: 280, 40
        prop lit = 0 ~quick
        box hit { from: 0, 0; size: 280, 40; corner: 10; color: mix(#1b1c1c, #2b2d2d, lit); cursor: pointer }
        box { from: 0, 8; size: 3, 24; corner: 1.5; color: mix(#9ed6bd, #e8776a, n.urgency == 2) }
        text "{upper(n.app)}  {n.title}{? · {n.body}}" { at: 12, 20; anchor: left center; size: 13; width: 260; lines: 1; color: ink }
        on enter hit { lit: 1 ~quick }
        on leave hit { lit: 0 ~quick }
        on press hit { emit opened(n.index) }
    }
}
```

A layer that decides, a popup, and the keyboard only while it is needed:

```plm
language 0.1
scene Reference2 {
    surface { size: 300, 60; anchor: top; keyboard: on_demand while open }
    fact open = false
    fact busy = false
    event saved
    prop glow = 0
    prop tint = 0

    layer mood ~quick {
        done    for 600ms after saved { tint: 1 ~lively }
        working while busy            { tint: 0.5 ~calm }
        idle                          { tint: 0 ~slow }
    }
    box button { at: 150, 30; size: 120, 34; corner: 17; color: mix(#2e2f2f, #9ed6bd, max(tint, glow)); cursor: pointer }
    text "Save" { at: 150, 30; anchor: center; size: 14; color: #f5f7f5; opacity: 60% + mood.idle * 40% }

    popup confirm { at: 90, 56; size: 120, 16 + choices.height; open: open
        body { color: #1b1c1c; box { from: 0, 0; size: 120, 16 + choices.height; corner: 10 } }
        column choices { at: 8, 8; gap: 4
            box yes { size: 104, 28; corner: 7; color: #9ed6bd }
            box no  { size: 104, 28; corner: 7; color: #3a3b3b }
        }
    }

    on press button  { toggle open }
    on press yes     { open = false; emit saved }
    on press no      { open = false }
    on key Escape    { open = false }
    on hover button for 200ms while not open { glow: 1 ~quick }
    on leave button  { glow: 0 ~quick }
}
```

A pose, a gesture and movement that carries itself: the face is the example, but it works for anything that has states and moves between them.

```plm
language 0.1
scene Reference3 {
    surface { size: 200, 200; anchor: center }
    pose eyes = 14
    pose look.y = 0
    prop lid = 1
    prop breath = 0
    prop gaze.x = 0 ~gentle
    prop gaze.y = 0 ~gentle
    fact searching = false
    event shutter

    body { color: #151616; rim: 5%; shadow: 0, 8, 24, 30%
        ellipse face { at: 100, 100 + breath; radius: 60 } }
    group {
        clip inset 3 ellipse { at: 100, 100; radius: 60 }
        box { at: 82 + gaze.x, 96 + gaze.y + look.y; size: 9, eyes * lid; corner: 4.5; color: #f5f7f5 }
        box { at: 118 + gaze.x, 96 + gaze.y + look.y; size: 9, eyes * lid; corner: 4.5; color: #f5f7f5 }
    }

    blink lid every 2.4s..6s for 170ms
    wave breath = 1.2 at 1.7
    look gaze.x, gaze.y at 100, 100 reach 6, 4 within 160

    gesture nod reflex {
        130ms out_quad              { look.y: 4; eyes: 10 }
        170ms out_back hold 60ms emit shutter { eyes: 15 }
        160ms
    }
    posture scanning while searching {
        400ms in_out_sine { look.y: -3 }
        400ms in_out_sine { look.y: 3 }
    }
    on press face { play nod }
}
```

## 17. The vocabulary, just as the compiler consults it

This is the output of `pleamar --grammar`, copied. It is not a second list: these are the same tables (`src/language/vocabulary.rs`) the compiler consults to accept or reject a word. `./run-tests.sh` compares this block with what the program prints —if somebody adds a word and does not write it down here, it fails— and it also checks that **every word appears in some test**.

`properties.shape` are the ones common to `ellipse`, `box`, `arc` and `line`; `properties.layout`, those of `row` and `column`.

## 17.1. In the editor

`pleamar --lsp` is a language server over the input and the output, with **this same compiler** behind it: the errors with their place while it is being written, which words are valid here, and what the one under the cursor means. `pleamar --highlight vim` and `--highlight vscode` write the syntax file, taken from the vocabulary above. Both, and how they are installed, are in `editor/`.

## 18. What this version does not have

So as not to look for it here: `import { Row } from …`, a line break in the layouts, times and plurals in the slots, and writing to the field of a record from a rule. It is all there, with its plan, in [Known limitations](08-limitations.md).
