//! The boundary with the system. Everything that knows about Wayland —and, the
//! day it's needed, about Win32 or AppKit— lives down here; the rest of the
//! program only knows this.
//!
//! A platform has to know how to do three things:
//!  · put up the surfaces a scene asks for (`Surface`: logical size,
//!    anchor, level, exclusive zone, screens) and hand them to the render as
//!    sheets, also when a monitor arrives or leaves, or changes scale;
//!  · tell the render where the mouse is and when it clicks;
//!  · tell the system where the mouse gets in (`PlatformWindow::update_input_region`),
//!    so that what's transparent lets the click through.
//!
//! And two that are not about windows: finding an icon by its name, and the
//! **services** —what happens in the system: workspaces, active window…—, which
//! the logic asks for by a name that is the same on every system. What a
//! system doesn't have, it says it doesn't have, and the scene decides what to do without it.
