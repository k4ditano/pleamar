//! A scene's logic, in Luau. It lives on its own thread, in a sandbox: no
//! files and no system, with a memory cap and with its seconds counted. If it
//! gets stuck nobody notices —the render does not wait for it—, and if it stays
//! in a loop forever, it gets cut off.
//!
//! The only thing it can do is what crosses the frontier: say what is true,
//! what a text says, that something has happened; and hear what happens in the scene.
//!
//! ```lua
//! fact.open = true                         -- a fact
//! text["notice.title"] = "Meeting"         -- a live text
//! emit("confirmed")   play("joy")          -- an event, a gesture
//! on("view_event", function(n) … end)      -- an event from the scene, with its payload
//! on("press:view", …)  on("enter:orb", …)  on("layer:card", function(claim) … end)
//! on("fact:open", function(v) … end)       -- a rule changed a fact
//! local t = every(1000, function() … end)  after(500, …)  cancel(t)
//! run("date", {"+%H:%M"}, function(out, code) … end)   -- a system command
//! ```
