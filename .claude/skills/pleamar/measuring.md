# Measuring pleamar against Quickshell

How the numbers in the README were taken, so they can be taken again the same
way. The point is to compare like with like: same machine, same monitor, both
freshly started, both animating.

## What to measure

```sh
# CPU, memory and threads of a process, over N seconds
medir() {
    pid=$1; sec=${2:-20}; label=${3:-process}
    hz=$(getconf CLK_TCK)
    c0=$(awk '{print $14+$15}' /proc/$pid/stat); t0=$(date +%s.%N)
    sleep "$sec"
    c1=$(awk '{print $14+$15}' /proc/$pid/stat); t1=$(date +%s.%N)
    rss=$(awk '/VmRSS/{print $2/1024}' /proc/$pid/status)
    pss=$(awk '/^Pss:/{s+=$2} END{print s/1024}' /proc/$pid/smaps_rollup)
    echo "$label · cpu $(echo "$c1 $c0 $hz $t1 $t0" | awk '{printf "%.2f", ($1-$2)/$3/($4-$5)*100}') % · rss $rss MB · pss $pss MB"
}
```

PSS is the honest memory figure: shared pages counted once, split between whoever
shares them.

## Frames and the cost of one

pleamar prints its own cycle when it exits, and with `PLEAMAR_TIMING=1` it breaks
down every frame:

```
cycle · 600 frames · mean 0.31 ms · p99 1.16 ms · max 1.63 ms
crono · hueco 16.04 · apuntar 0.10 · cerrar 0.21 · mandar+presentar 0.23 ms
```

"hueco" is waiting for the monitor: that is **sleep**, not CPU. What costs is the
rest, and it is the floor of wgpu on Vulkan: about 0.5 ms per frame whatever is
drawn (limitation P11).

For Quickshell, `QSG_RENDER_TIMING=1` makes Qt print one line per frame with
`polish`, `sync`, `render` and `swap`, plus `perWindowFrameDelta`. Count the
lines to get frames per second, average the numbers to get the cost of a frame.

## Checking an animation against its contract

The other kind of measuring, and the one that gets used daily: not what it
costs, but **whether it lasts what it says**. `--record` prints the value of
properties, facts and live texts once per frame:

```sh
pleamar --scene marea.plm --no-hud --stall 0 --seconds 8 \
        --record calma,dibuja,capsula > log.tsv
```

```
record · there is nothing called 'px' · there is px#Hat2, px#Mug4
ms	calma	dibuja	capsula
1528.3	0.0000	0.0000	0.0000
1545.0	0.1220	0.0000	0.0000
```

- The names are the ones the scene declares. **Inside a component's copy they
  carry their mark** (`px#Hat2`), which is why it says what there is when it
  cannot find one.
- Driving it: `--mouse "360,30@400 click@1500"` for the pointer, `--say` from
  another shell for facts and events. Both are exact in time; the real mouse is
  not.
- Reading it: `grep -P '^[\d.]+\t' log.tsv | awk …`. What is usually wanted is
  when something crosses 1 % and 99 % of its travel, because a spring declared
  `~320ms` is one that reaches 99 % at 320 ms.

```sh
grep -P '^[\d.]+\t' log.tsv | awk -F'\t' '
  {t=$1+0; v=$2+0; if(v>0.01 && a==0) a=t; if(a>0 && v>=0.99 && b==0) b=t}
  END{printf "1%%→99%%: %.0f ms\n", b-a}'
```

And two traps worth knowing:

- A one-frame spring (`~16ms`) used **to be able to measure** something adds its
  own lag: at 1 200 px/s that is 33 px. If what is wanted is the drawn value and
  it comes from an expression, register what it is made of and do the sum in
  `awk` instead of adding a property that changes the answer.
- With nothing moving, pleamar **sleeps**: a log with 32 rows in five seconds is
  not a stutter, it is the scene being still. Compare frame counts only between
  two runs that are both animating.

## Restarting someone's bar without losing it

Save its environment and its command line **before** killing it, and put it back
the same way:

```sh
pid=$(pgrep -x quickshell)
tr '\0' ' ' < /proc/$pid/cmdline        # the command
tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$pid/environ       # its variables, which may matter
```

A shell usually carries variables of its own (`MAREA_ROOT`, `MAREA_AVISOS`…). A
Python script that reads `/proc/<pid>/environ` into a dict and calls `Popen(env=…,
start_new_session=True)` puts it back exactly as it was.

## What to watch out for

- **Quickshell's numbers move** with how long it has been up and what has been
  opened. Freshly started: 5.75 % and 386 MB. After hours: 13.2 % and 188 MB.
  Always compare bars with the same uptime.
- **Opening a panel leaves things behind in QML**: CPU goes up and does not come
  back down. In pleamar it returns, because nothing is instantiated.
- **The two bars rarely hold the same things.** Say so when reporting: a panel
  with a chat inside is not the same panel.
- Measure with the mouse away from both, or the hover animations skew it.
